# Sherlock
```toc

- Outer loop: Sherlock (Katz et al., 1998) tutors the troubleshooting of a large piece of simulated electrical equipment, an avionics test station.
- It provides many views on the equipment and its schematics, so no screenshots are included here.
- Inner loop: Troubleshooting the equipment requires taking many steps, such as measuring voltages and replacing suspect parts. Sherlock gives unsolicited feedback only if a step is unsafe, that is, if the step would cause serious damage to the equipment or the student if it were done in the real world
- Sherlock also makes extensive feedback available after the student has solved the problem. Sherlock's default post-solution feedback is to display a side-by-side summary of the student's solution and Sherlock's ideal solution.

>   - If instructors sometimes disagree on what makes for the best solution to the problem, it might be wise to subcategorize non-optimal. For instance, because some [[Sherlock]] instructors emphasize reducing time and others emphasize reducing costs, [[Sherlock]] could subcategorize non-optimal steps as wastes time or wastes parts. In short, the categories used for minimal feedback should reflect the pedagogical policies of the instructors.

>   - Delayed feedback: Only if the step violates a safety regulation will [[Sherlock]] give immediate feedback as the student solves a problem. However, after the problem is solved, the student can request a reviewing mode where minimal feedback is given. In particular, as [[Sherlock]] replays the student's solution step-by-step, it indicates which steps did not contribute any diagnostic information.
