- ADE’s ROBUST program on Auditing for Responsible AI Software System (SAFE-GUARD), which is financed under the NWO LTP funding scheme with Deloitte as the key industry partner. 
-   
    The overall objective of SAFE-GUARD is auditing of AI software, it may be further refined in the following more elaborated goal: "Explore, develop and validate novel auditing theories, tools, and methodologies that will be able to monitor and audit whether AI applications adhere in terms of fairness (no bias), explainability, and transparency (easy to explain), robustness and reliability (delivering same results under various execution environments), respect of privacy (respecting GDPR), and safety and security (with no vulnerabilities)."
-   
    The industrial setting of the deep involvement of Deloitte will balance the rigour with relevance and ascertain fit with societal requirements and trends, validation with industrial case studies.
- Application software developers cannot train-, test- and deploy AI models independent of socio-political, ethical, cultural, and personal context. At the same time, data is not objective: it is inherently reflective of pre-existing social and cultural biases, thus implying that AI (and AI-induced applications) may lead to (unintended) negative consequences and inequitable outcomes in practical settings. This project will develop novel methodologies, including techniques and tools, that can be exploited during audit activity when detecting AI software bias, possibly predicting those conditions and recommending ways to triage them. These aspects render important aspects when developing trustworthy AI software.

Hello Joaquin,

  

My name is Subhaditya, it is nice to meet you :)

  

I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am now looking for a job in the Netherlands. I remember seeing the OpenML Github repo a while back and thinking it would be really cool to work with AI researchers with a love for open source. But I had just started my masters then, and somehow did not end up reaching out. So when I found this position while looking through Academic Transfer, I absolutely had to apply. I have been working with software engineering and AI for a few years now and I am very aware of the need for accurate benchmarks and sharing models efficiently. With so many people suddenly giving in to the AI hype, crafting tools that cater to the real problems of researchers trying to build AI, something like OpenML is even more relevant now. Given that, I would love to bring my experience to this position, while also hopefully learning a lot from your team there too.

  

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI and data projects to life. My experience includes working with large datasets, building ML/DL models and pipelines and also sharing my knowledge with my peers in technical and non technical fields. I am quite good at using PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras and have some experience with Flux.jl and Max as well. I am also familiar with the Hugging Face API / PyTorch lightning and the ONNX format. More than anything though, I am a programmer at heart. I have been an avid believer in open source ever since I started using linux almost seven years ago, and although I have a lot to learn, I do think that I am a good fit for this position. (Here is my Github - [http://github.com/subhadityamukherjee](http://github.com/subhadityamukherjee))

  

This letter is getting a little long, but I did want to add that I would love to contribute to OpenML and bring about positive changes in the AI community going forward. So many people with not much AI experience are starting to enter this field, and perhaps we could help make their experience a lot smoother, while also promoting more open source research. I have no means of knowing how experienced the other candidates are, but I do hope you give me a shot!

  

PS. I still have my Zoekjaar visa till September, so I can start ASAP as well.

Hello! (I want to say James, but I am not sure)

  

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am now looking for a job in the Netherlands. As a software engineer with an interest in healthcare and experience in AI, the FAIR RSE position seemed like the perfect next step for me, and I did not want to miss out on applying for it. Having been working on computer vision for a few years now, I am very aware of the need for better data management, especially for complex and privacy oriented workflows. I would love to bring this experience to DIAG, while also hopefully learning a lot from the team there too.

  

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI and data projects to life. My experience includes working with large datasets, building ML/DL models and pipelines and also sharing my knowledge with my peers in technical and non technical fields. I have worked with AWS, Google Cloud and DICOM before as well. I am quite proficient in Python, CI/CD and integrating 3rd party APIs with existing codebases. 

I have a masters in AI (with my thesis being on Explainable AI) and that also brought me  experience with setting up training and also the FAIR principles. More importantly though, using AI in healthcare has been my motivation for many years now, and one of the reasons I got into the field in the first place. That being the case, I feel like I am in a better position compared to general software engineers in understanding what is required and why.

  

This letter is getting a little long, but I did want to add that I would love to contribute to your team’s mission of making Radboud UMC the best campus for AI research, and in turn helping a lot of researchers get their work done faster and more responsibly. I do hope you give me a shot :)

  

Best,

Subhaditya Mukherjee

Hello!

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Deeploy from the NLAIC website, and then from one of your colleagues - Nilay, who I met at an AI event in Amsterdam. My masters thesis was an XAI project, and when I saw how much your team works on that, I had to give it a shot. I am currently looking for an AI role in the NL and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at Deeploy.

  

My experience is a combination of AI and Data Analytics, with an extra interest in XAI. I am good at setting up and tuning open source models across all levels. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am also quite familiar with AI libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow along with MLOps tools. I have worked quite extensively with Neptune, Tensorboard and Docker for many years as well. Given a chance, I would love to bring this experience to continue building responsible and explainable AI at Deeploy.

  

While I am not sure what kind of roles exist at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. I’ve also attached my resume to this email as a little more background if that helps. If you are hiring or will be soon, I would love to have a chat!

Hello Andrew,

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Quin from Linkedin and was very interested in your AI-based health platform. Combining multiple data sources to provide a holistic and real-time view of a patient's health sounds like a rather challenging and useful problem to solve, and I'd love to contribute to your mission of future-proofing Healthcare. I am currently looking for an AI role in the NL and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at Quin.

  

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. My experience includes working with large datasets, building ML/DL models (Both LLM and Computer vision) and deploying them in production. I have also worked with the MLOps stack and have experience with Docker, CI/CD, AWS and of course, a large part of the Deep Learning stack. I am quite familiar with AI libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow and have created many projects using them. I would love to bring this experience to continue building on the AI engine your team is working on and also constantly learning about what’s new in the field.

  

While I am not sure what kind of roles exist at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. I’ve also attached my resume to this email as a little more background if that helps. If you are hiring or will be soon, I would love to have a chat!

Hello!

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Kepler Vision from the NLAIC website, and saw that your team was looking for a software engineering intern. The Night Nurse software seems like a great project to start my career with and this email is my application for this position. I hope to get to learn a lot about how to be a good part of an engineering team, while also bringing my AI experience to the table.

  

While I don’t know what criteria you have in selecting an intern, this opportunity would be the absolute best next step for me. My main interests lie in Computer Vision, especially in using AI in healthcare. And somehow, this is exactly what this internship offers to teach? It would be such a miss if I did not try my best to get in.

  

My experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. But, what I now need to learn is how to work on larger scale projects such as Night Nurse. I am quite good with Python, FastAPI, and AI frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow, but am not very familiar with Terraform or Typescript. I definitely want to learn them though! And this internship would be absolutely perfect.

  

I promise to put my best foot forward given a chance. I am quite a fast learning, and have a strong base in programming and AI. I hope you give me a shot. 

  

PS. I have the Zuikjaar visa as well, valid for almost a year. So no issues there either.

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about GrwNxt from the NLAIC website and was intrigued by the concept of GrwNxt Modules and how they could be used for reliably, combining Deep learning and plant science. I can imagine just how useful and scalable the technology would be, especially combined with AI and computer vision. The work your team does is very much in line with my interests and experience, and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at GrwNxt.

  

My experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision, which is something I see that your team works on as well. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. Now that I have a masters in AI, I’m trying to find places I can contribute the most to, and I think GrwNxt fits quite well to that. From the presentation on your website, I see that the modules would use a lot of advanced data analytics combined with computer vision, which is what I am the most familiar with. I am proficient at using Deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and am comfortable with all stages of the AI pipeline. Since my main focus has always been Computer vision, I can help your team implement the advanced data analysis pipelines faster as well. 

  

This project really interests me and while I am not sure what kind of roles you have at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. Being able to contribute to the sustainable food revolution is such a good cause, and I would love to be a part of it.

Stampix’ users through analysis of user-generated images

  

  

Hello Julie!

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about ML6 from the NLAIC website and the first thing that caught my eye was the Stampix’ analysis project that your team did recently. I did a little more reading, and found so many interesting projects that I had to reach out. I think it’s very important to find a job that you would actually enjoy and that being the case, I would love to discuss the possibility of any AI/Data Analytics roles at ML6.

  

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. My main experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision, but I have worked across many domains and am quite comfortable with learning something new. I have been working with AI for a long time now, and am quite familiar with the stack - from libraries like PyTorch ,Tensorflow and sklearn to others like Git and Azure. Something that I think would be a good fit with both the ML6 agents and the Maffia :)

  

Aside from all the technical stuff, I quite enjoy consulting. Since I already have the programming background, it is also a lot easier for me to explain what goes behind making the projects requested by clients. And also guide them across the stages.

  

While I am not sure what roles are available at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. I’ve also attached my resume to this email as a little more background if that helps. If you are hiring or will be soon, I would love to have a chat!

Hello Yagmur!

My name is Subhaditya, it’s nice to meet you :)

I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am now looking for a position where I can bring my AI knowledge to healthcare. I found out about this position quite coincidentally a few hours ago, and I knew that I could not miss the chance to apply. There is a history of Parkinsons in my family and while I could do nothing about it as a kid, now I can help contribute to the research. So, here is my formal application to the PhD position :’ Artificial intelligence for monitoring of Parkinson’s disease’.

  

I read that a lot of data was collected over the last few years using a smartwatch and video in the hope of gaining insights that would potentially help a lot of people. Here is where I can contribute to the most. I am not a healthcare professional, and all these years there wasn’t any skill I could bring to the medical side of innovation. But now I have quite a bit of experience in both Computer Vision and Data Analysis. I am comfortable with using deep learning libraries, data analysis pipelines and python to create whatever is necessary for the project. My main skills lie in building these pipelines, analyzing data and subsequently using AI. Over the past few years, I have done many freelance projects, each of which has given me quite a bit of knowledge about using AI in different domains. I think that that knowledge will be useful here too.

I can use my AI skills to further accelerate research. Since I am familiar with the pipline, perhaps I can also help anticipate what might be needed for the future, and ensure we are a little more ready for that. I have also worked quite a bit with vision models and sensor data in past internships and personal projects, which is also useful experience.

  

Aside from the technical aspects, I love interdisciplinary research. No field is good on it’s own, AI even less so. But that being the case, I acknowledge my lack of information about medical terms. I do think that is an easy fix though, and I’m willing to put in the effort to learn that side as best I can. This position is the perfect next step for me, as someone who is trying to find a position that bridges the gap between a pure AI background to something more useful, healthcare. I read that your lab is part of the ICAI network as well, and Verity healthcare too. That’s so awesome and helpful.

  

I have done many projects and internships over the past few years, but for most of the time, it did not feel like my work amounted to anything. This is my shot at making it count, and helping make some lives a little better. I know I applied pretty late and you probably have a lot of applications already, but I hope you give me a chance!

Hello Yagmur!

My name is Subhaditya, it’s nice to meet you :) I just finished my masters in AI from the RUG and am now looking for a PhD position in the NL.

  

I found out about the PhD position ’ Artificial intelligence for monitoring of Parkinson’s disease’ a few hours ago and I knew I could not miss the chance to apply. The position is a perfect fit of what I want to do next, and where I can contribute my skills the most. 

  

The reason for this email though, is a little embarrassing. It’s a Saturday morning, two days before the deadline. Which I know is super late. You probably now have a lot of candidates and I don’t know if you will even get to my application.

  

But honestly, I just found out about it. So I hope you give me a shot!

Hello Ante,

  

It's nice to meet you! 

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found the position a good fit for what I can offer and what I want to do next, and so this is my formal application for the AI Strategist position.

  

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I have a mix of experience, ranging from consulting to building technical AI projects across domains. I believe that this experience makes me a good fit for this position, as not only can I map out the steps needed to arrive at an AI based product, I can also break it down across multiple levels of understanding.  I have been working with AI for a long time now, and am quite familiar with the stack - from LLMs to GenAI to other advanced AI models. I also have an understanding of reinforcement learning and am pretty proficient in Python. 

  

I understand just how deeply important ethically future proofing the baking system is. The world is moving ahead with AI, and if we do not keep up with the trend, it will move ahead without us. I hope to be part of that change at Rabobank, and help co-create strategies that help the workforce in the long run.

  

Hope to hear from you soon :)
