# Adrenal Glands
- Located on top of each kidney, these two glands are involved in the body’s response to stress and help regulate growth, blood [glucose](Glucose.md) levels, and the body’s metabolic rate. They receive signals from the brain and secrete several different hormones in response, including [cortisol](Cortisol.md) and [adrenaline](Adrenaline.md).
