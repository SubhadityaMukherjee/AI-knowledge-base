# Orthogonal Initialization
- simple approach to solving the problem [Vanishingexploding gradients](Vanishingexploding%20gradients.md)
- when applying repeated matrix multiplications, the eigenvalues are what dictate the growth or death of the result
- eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices have an absolute value of 1
- no matter how many matrix multiplications the result doesen't explode nor vanishes
