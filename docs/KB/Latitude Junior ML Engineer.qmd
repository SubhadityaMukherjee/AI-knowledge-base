# Latitude Junior ML Engineer


As the days go by, Machine Learning and AI are slowly becoming terms that every company wants to have in their portfolio. While this drive leads to many innovations, most companies are not sure how to do AI "well". They want to use AI but need clarification on whether it is required, how to handle bias, how to create proper data, or even what models (ML vs. DL) to choose. I believe that the Latitude data-first approach is the way to go, and in the long run, this approach will help many companies achieve their vision of AI. I love solving problems with creative analytics, and this application is to get a chance to take part in Latitude's mission to make a difference to customers with data.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. That being the case, I can step aside from my experience with AI and decide if a project needs another solution in reality. I have experience finding proper KPIs and can phrase them in the context of an ML (or not) problem and provide a means to solve them.

The customer is king, they say, and the first step in having happy clients is understanding what they truly want and then being able to give them a solution they can use. That being the case, in any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing solutions that have a positive impact, and I can contribute quite a bit to any team I get the chance to work with.
