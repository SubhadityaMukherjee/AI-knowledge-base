# Freedom
- (N, D, P) N samples, D [degrees of freedom](Degrees%20of%20Freedom.md)
- If N<D , then ill posed
- Need N >> D
- If P learnable params , $$P<N$$ : underspecified
- If $$P >> N$$ : overparameterized
- No of params not a good indicator of overfitting
- Solution : [Regularization](Regularization.md)
