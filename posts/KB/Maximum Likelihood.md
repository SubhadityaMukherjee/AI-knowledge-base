# Maximum Likelihood

## Effect
- Consider a model $f[x, \phi]$ that computes an output from input $x$.
- Consider the model computes a conditional probability distribution $Pr(Y|x)$ , Y is output
- This encourages each output $y_i$ to have high probability under $Pr(y_{i}|x_{i})$ computed from input $x_{i}$

## Computing a distribution over inputs
- Choose a parametric distribution $Pr(y|\theta)$ defined on output domain y. 
- use the network to compute one or more of the parameters $\theta$ of this distribution
- For example, suppose the prediction domain is the set of real numbers, so y ∈ R. Here, we might choose the univariate normal distribution, which is defined on R. This distribution is defined by the mean μ and variance σ2, so θ = {μ,σ^2}. The machine learning model might predict the mean μ, and the variance σ^2 could be treated as an unknown constant.

## Inference
- When we perform inference, we often want a point estimate rather than a distribution, so we return the maximum of the distribution
