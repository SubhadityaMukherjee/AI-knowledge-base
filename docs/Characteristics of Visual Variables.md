# Characteristics of Visual Variables
- Selective | Can this variable allow us to spontaneously differentiate/isolate items from groups? [i.e., 1 item from all]
- Associative | Can this variable allow us to spontaneously group items in a group? [i.e., 1 group from all]
- Ordered | Can this variable allow us to spontaneously perceive an order [i.e., what is smaller and what is bigger?]
- Quantitative | Can the difference between two marks in this variable be interpreted numerically? [i.e., corresponds to 5?]
- Length (resolution) | Across how many changes in this variable are distinctions possible? [i.e., how many can I see?]
