- **05:48** While I wait to get a job, theres so many things I want to learn. I think the biggest hurdle for me in getting a place is that my background is too niche and advanced for the kind of places I can get now. Even if that is not fully true, I should learn more general skills. The easiest would be to focus on MLOps. 
	- I want to build a little list of things to learn in it and then try to do some crash course type things so I can learn a bit more of proper software eng. If I get the position im waiting for, this will help me more than anything else that's more technical and harder to learn.
