- 
- or DeepRED
- TREPAN is an algorithm for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks
- The authors demonstrated that TREPAN is able to produce Decision [[Trees]] that are accurate and comprehensible and maintain a high level of fidelity to the networks from which they were extracted.
- According to the authors of DeepRED, their method is the first attempt to extract rules and make a DNN's decision more transparent.
