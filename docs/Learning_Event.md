# Learning Event
```toc
```

- A learning event is the construction or application of a [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md), often while trying to achieve the task. Learning events are mental events, whereas steps are physical events. A learning event occurs in the mind of the student where it cannot be observed, whereas a step occurs on the user interface and the computer can observe it. In the algebra example mentioned earlier, the step x=18.46 can be considered to result from three learning events: $$2.3*x=42.45 (cid:198) x=42.45/2.3 (cid:198) x=18.4565â€¦ (cid:198) x=18.46$$
