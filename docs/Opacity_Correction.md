# Opacity Correction
- Opacity component $o$ in [transfer function](Transfer_Function.md) stored with respect to a standard step size $\Delta t$
- Different step sizes $\Delta t^{\ast}$
- Dynamic step sizes
- generate pre-integrated function
- $$o^{\ast} = 1- (1-o)^{\frac{\Delta t^{\ast}}{\Delta t}}$$
- evaluate after obtaining $o$ from [transfer function](Transfer_Function.md)
- apply before compositing`
