# Subhaditya Mukherjee : Rabobank - AI Strategist Application


    

Hello Ante,

It's nice to meet you! 
My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found the position a good fit for what I can offer and what I want to do next, and so this is my formal application for the AI Strategist position.

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I have a mix of experience, ranging from consulting to building technical AI projects across domains. I believe that this experience makes me a good fit for this position, as not only can I map out the steps needed to arrive at an AI based product, I can also break it down across multiple levels of understanding.  I have been working with AI for a long time now, and am quite familiar with the stack - from LLMs to GenAI to other advanced AI models. I also have an understanding of reinforcement learning and am pretty proficient in Python. 

I understand just how deeply important ethically future proofing the baking system is. The world is moving ahead with AI, and if we do not keep up with the trend, it will move ahead without us. I hope to be part of that change at Rabobank, and help co-create strategies that help the workforce in the long run.

Hope to hear from you soon :)
