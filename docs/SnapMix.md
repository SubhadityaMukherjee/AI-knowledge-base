# SnapMix
- augments training images by ex- tracting and merging random image regions of dif- ferent sizes, where the region size is drawn through the beta distribution for both the images.
- Gen- erated image label is assigned based on semantic composition from normalized (sum to one) CAMs.
- However, the summation of label coefficients can exceed beyond one depending on the semantic composition of the output image.
