# GAU
- gated [attention](Attention.md) unit; a generalization of GLU - gated linear unit
- allows for better and more efficient approximation of multi-head [attention](Attention.md) than many other efficient [attention](Attention.md) methods by using a weaker single-head [attention](Attention.md) with minimal quality loss
