- **10: 27** I feel out of touch with DL. Ill try to read a paper today and make notes on it. Maybe I should do some more fun reading. Rn its pretty overwhelming and boring.
- **10: 36** Should I start blogging again?
- Im not sure. I feel like it might be good for me.. But it seems a bit overwhelming again. I also want to go through this KB and add whatever I want to specific topics. Anything I do not understand. Maybe I can flag them with a #blog
- hmm. After I go through this current paper, I will do that.
- I realized I can write 'microblogs'
- Just short things, what, why, how. Will take the pressure off me and also help me remember things better. Maybe I can just have a little folder of articles. Hmm.
- **11:13** I read the distillation paper. Ill get back to writing notes on it soon. For now Ill go and tend to my digital garden of knowledge.
