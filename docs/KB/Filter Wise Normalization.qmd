# Filter Wise Normalization


- Following up from [Random Directions](Random Directions.qmd) 
$$
d_{i,j} \leftarrow \frac{d_{i,j}}{||d_{i,j}||}||\theta_{i,j}||
$$
	- d is a random Gaussian Direction vector
	- $d_{i,j}$ is $j_{th}$ filter of the $i_{th}$ layer of the direction vector d
	- $||\cdot||$ is the [Frobenius norm](Frobenius norm.qmd)
