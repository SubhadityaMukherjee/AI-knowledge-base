# Amdahl's Law
- Maximum expected improvement to an overall system when only part of the system is improved
- Theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors
- $$Speedup = \frac{\text{Execution time before improvement}}{\text{Execution time after improvement}}$$
- $$Speedup = ((1-f_{E})+(\frac{f_{E}}{f_{I}}))^{-1}$$
	- $f_E$ is fraction enhanced
	- $f_{I}$ is factor of improvement
	- $S_{e}$ is speedup enhanced
- $$ExecutionTime_{new} = ExecutionTime_{old}\times [(1-f_{E})+f_{E}/S_{e}]$$
- $$MaximumSpeedupp = n/(1+(n-1)f )$$
	- n is no of processors
