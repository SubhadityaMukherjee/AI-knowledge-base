# HyTAS


## Rebuttal
### Reviewer 2
- which seems to have the problem of local optimization
	- HyTAS seems to test specific variants of the same architecture : increasing depth/width. I think the reviewer meant that it does not test different kinds of transformer architectures -> more branches/more concatenations etc. 
	- they thought it was a general metric to evaluate any kind of transformer. this is not the case. perhaps a clarification would be nice?
- more detailed optimization
	- architecture diagram

### General Comments
- ZICO -> ZICO++ ?
- difference between CNNs and transformers and why this architecture specifically?
