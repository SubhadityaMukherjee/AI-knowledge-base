# Normalized Inverted [Structural Similarity Index](Structural%20Similarity%20Index.md)
- metric is calculated from [Structural Similarity Index](Structural%20Similarity%20Index.md) by inverting the range and then normalizing it.
- NISSIM bounds to (0, 1] where 0 means similar and 1 means dissimilar. Ideally we want this value as close to 0 as possible
- $$NISSIM_{i}= \frac{1-SSIM_{i}}{2}$$
