# Humanoid Vision Engine
```toc
```

- HVE
- summarize the contribution of shape, texture, and color in a given task (dataset) by separately computing the three features to support image classification
- end-to-end learning with backpropagation to simulate the learning process of humans and to summarize the contribution of shape, texture, and color
- advantage of end-to-end training is that we can avoid introducing human bias, which may influence the objective of contribution attribution
