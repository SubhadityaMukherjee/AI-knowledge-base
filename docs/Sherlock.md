# Sherlock
```toc
```

- Outer loop: Sherlock (Katz et al., 1998) tutors the troubleshooting of a large piece of simulated electrical equipment, an avionics test station.
- It provides many views on the equipment and its schematics, so no screenshots are included here.
- Inner loop: Troubleshooting the equipment requires taking many steps, such as measuring voltages and replacing suspect parts. Sherlock gives unsolicited feedback only if a step is unsafe, that is, if the step would cause serious damage to the equipment or the student if it were done in the real world
- Sherlock also makes extensive feedback available after the student has solved the problem. Sherlock's default post-solution feedback is to display a side-by-side summary of the student's solution and Sherlock's ideal solution.
