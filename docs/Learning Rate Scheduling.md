# Learning Rate [Scheduling](Scheduling.md)
- [Learning Rate Decay tricks](Learning%20Rate%20Decay%20tricks.md)
- [Gradient Descent gradients](Gradient%20Descent%20gradients.md)
- Increasing the batch size, reduces noise in the #gradients so a larger learning rate is okay
- [Linear Learning Rate Scaling](Linear%20Learning%20Rate%20Scaling.md)
- [Learning Rate Warmup](Learning%20Rate%20Warmup.md)
