# DrawBench
- comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models
- With [DrawBench](DrawBench.md), we compare Imagen with recent methods including [VQGAN](VQGAN)+[CLIP](CLIP.md), [Latent Diffusion](Latent%20Diffusion) Models, and [DALL-E](DALL-E.md), and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment
