# [Entropy](Entropy.qmd) Minimization by Adverarial Learning
- A limitation of the [entropy](Entropy.qmd) loss is related to the absence of structural dependencies between local semantics.
- This is caused by the aggregation of the pixel-wise prediction entropies by summation.
- unified adversarial training framework which minimizes indirectly the [entropy](Entropy.qmd) of target data, by encouraging it to become similar to the source one.
- minimizing distribution distance between source and target on the weighted self-information space
- We perform the adversarial adaptation on weighted self-information maps using a fully-convolutional discriminator network
- the discriminator produces domain classification outputs, i.e., class label for the source (resp. target) domain.
- discriminate outputs coming from source and target images, and at the same time, train the segmentation network to fool the discriminator.
