# Degrees of Freedom
- The number of independent directions or joints of the robot (R15.07), which would allow the robot to move its end effector through the required sequence of motions. For arbitrary positioning, 6 degrees of freedom are needed: 3 for position (left-right, forward-backward and up- down), and 3 for orientation ([[Yaw|yaw]], pitch and [[Roll|roll]]).
