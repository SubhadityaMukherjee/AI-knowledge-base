# Pre Integrated Volume Rendering
- Assume
	- Linear interpolations of scalar values in a ray segment
	- Constant length of ray segment L
- Pre computation from a slab
- $$s_{L}(t) = s_{b}+ \frac{t}{L}(s_{f}-s_{b})$$
- becomes
- $$c_{i}= \int_{0}^{L}g(t)e^{-\int_{t}^{L}{\kappa(t')d_{t}}}dt' $$
- $$o_{i}= e^{\int_{0}^{L}\kappa(t)}d_{t} $$
