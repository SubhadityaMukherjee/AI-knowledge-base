Please read the FAQs!

## Instructions and FAQ
The more specific your request, the better you will get an answer to them. 
Please Please drop your name and email. It would make it so much easier to contact you.
FAQ:
- Will you do my homework?
	- Probably not. I take no responsibility for the grades you get. 

- How long will it take you to write my article?
	- That depends on your topic. Around 3 days is a good estimate. Although I would be able to give you a better estimate once I see the topic.

- Can I distribute this article freely?
	- Generally yes. You must link to my page and have my name on it though. If you are going to monetise it, well. I can’t really stop you but then I will monetise it too.

- Will it be public?
	- That is your choice. Generally, yes. But if you want it on your website/company website, then just inform me before. As long as you credit me properly wherever you post it, I’m okay with that.

- Will you make a whole framework for me?
	- Nope. You will get demo code. Full code etc will be a lot more time intensive so the rate will be decided based on the request.

- How many rewrites do I get?
	- Minor changes : two times.
	- Major changes : once. 
	- Delays suck for both of us. So if you want something specific, it’s better you tell me before I start.

- Delays
	- I am not GPT-3, and sometimes I do face delays in getting work done. If I do though, I will keep you informed.

- Refunds
	- Oops, you didn’t like what you got. Apologies. If you can convince me that it was a badly written article, even after 2 minor and 1 major change, I will send you half your money back. After all, it did take a lot of my time. I don’t want to encourage scams, so I hope you understand.

## Thank you! 
I hope we can both enjoy this article.
If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to drop me a message or email at msubhaditya@gmail.com
