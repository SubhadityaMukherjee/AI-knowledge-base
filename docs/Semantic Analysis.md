# Semantic Analysis
- Meaning of the language
- Meanings of the word to extend and perhaps disambiguate the result returned by the syntactic parse
- Look up the individual words in a dictionary (or [Lexicon](Lexicon.md)) and extract their meanings
- But many words have several meanings
	- [Lexical Disambiguation](Lexical%20Disambiguation.md)
- [Sentence level processing](Sentence%20level%20processing.md)
