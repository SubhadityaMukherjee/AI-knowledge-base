# Word Vectors
- Essentially word [[Embedding]]
- Text processing
- We can represent ideas/sentences/documents as vectors to feed into any kind of model
- Useful because vectors can be easily compared to find similarity
	- eg : [[Cosine_Similarity]]
- Higher dimensions make it challenging
- 
- Vectors that are metrically close to each other
- [[GloVE]]
