# Centrifugal [[Force]]
- When a body rotates about an axis other than one at it's center of mass, it exerts an outward radial [[Force]] called centrifugal [[Force]] upon the axis, which restrains it from moving in a straight tangential line. To offset this [[Force]], the robot must exert an opposing torque at the joint of rotation.
