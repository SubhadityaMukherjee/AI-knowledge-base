# Research Distillation
- It can be incredibly satisfying, combining deep scientific understanding, empathy, and design to do justice to our research and lay bare beautiful insights.
- Distillation is also hard
- It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea.
- This kind of refinement of an idea can take just as much effort and deep understanding as the initial discovery.
- We can’t solve [research debt](Research%20Debt.md) by having one person write a textbook
