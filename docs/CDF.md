>   - latent space interpolation followed two useful principles when sampling the latent space of a generative model avoid sampling from locations that are highly unlikely given the prior of the model. being used in the original VAE paper which adjusted sampling through the inverse [[CDF]] of the Gaussian to accommodate the Gaussian prior recognize that the dimensionality of the latent space is often artificially high and may contains dead zones that are not on the manifold learned during training implies that simply matching the model's prior will not always be sufficient to yield samples that appear to have been drawn from the training set
