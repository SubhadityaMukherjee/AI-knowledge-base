# Joint Motion Type
- Also known as [Point-to-Point](Point-to-Point.md) Motion, Joint Motion Type is a method of path interpolation that commands the movement of the robot by moving each joint directly to the commanded position so that all axis arrive to the position at the same time. Although the path is predictable, it will not be linear.
