# Conditioning
- Unconditioned Stimulus (US) (=food)
- Another feature or cue (bell), becomes Conditioned Stimulus (CS)
- A response that indicates association (salvation)
- The unconditioned stimulus is what we want to predict, our outcome
- Conditioned Stimuli or cues are the [features](Features.md) we are learning to use to predict the outcome (US)
- Current Vector V t ij changes with each learning instance
- $$V_{ij}^{t+1}= V_{ij}^{t}+ \Delta V_{ij}^{t}$$
- $$\Delta V_{ij}^{t}=(1-\text{connection weight}_{j}^{t})$$
- ▶ V = association strength ▶ i = current input (cue) ▶ j = current output (outcome) ▶ ∆ V : Change in association strength
- Pavlov discovered evidence of positive associations
- Associations increase in strength whenever a feature and a cue occur together
