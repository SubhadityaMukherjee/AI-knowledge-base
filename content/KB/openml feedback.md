- dataset size
	- gui interface does not really work for it
	- bitbucket
	- dataset class
- evaluation datasets
- automl
	- company - pdf export, excel export
		- monetization (probably not but yeah)
	- academia - model download
	- information - metrics, performance metrics, how long it take to run
	- what to do next from here?
		- data distribution is narrow for example
		- how to optimize diff metrics
		- run `autoattack` model : adversarial robustness guarantees
		- what can be derived from the data
	- similar datasets
		- acting like a proxy
- how can you help people with all the knowledge in OpenML

- part time lecturer business Tue-dublin + phd
- hasnt super used it before
- [keel](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/datasets.php)
	- randomized dataset
	- different variants of datasets
- hard to understand which is original
- keep track of results manually
- ran small scale only and openml feels large scale
- found openml because of datasets
	- unique datasets
- feels like itll do everything automatically
- phd 
	- metalearning - feature selection recommendation
		- ~100 datasets
	- auto extraction of target variables
		- first and last col : column
		- images features - issues (like mnist)
