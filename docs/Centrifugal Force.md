# Centrifugal [Force](Force.md)
- When a body rotates about an axis other than one at it's center of mass, it exerts an outward radial [force](Force.md) called centrifugal [force](Force.md) upon the axis, which restrains it from moving in a straight tangential line. To offset this [force](Force.md), the robot must exert an opposing torque at the joint of rotation.
