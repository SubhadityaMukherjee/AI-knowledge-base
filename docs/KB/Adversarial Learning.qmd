# Adversarial Learning
- Consider data in a [Manifold](Manifold.qmd). The [PDF](PDF.qmd) is concentrated along a low dim [Manifold](Manifold.qmd) $\mathcal{M}$
- Now the original picture is a point on the [Manifold](Manifold.qmd) (dim = output layer size)
- Add noise to the image such that the image now appears to be in a direction orthogonal to $\mathcal{M}$ -> value of [PDF](PDF.qmd) shrinks dramatically
- Then the network has never seen this before and will return a random classification
