# Mean Observed Dissimilarity
- is the mean of the NISSIM dissimilarity over the adversarial test set for similar levels of attack.
- So for every adversarial set X âˆ—, calculate NISSIM value for all samples in that set, and divide by the total number of samples.
- (0,1], such that 0 indicates total similarity while 1 indicates total dissimilarity
- $$MOD_{advset}= \frac{1}{N}\Sigma (NISSIM_{i})$$
