# Bag of Words


## Explained
- Count based conversion of document into fixed length vectors of integers
- `John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.`
	- `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.`
	- `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- Order is arbitary

## Disadvantages
- Lose all info about word order
- Does not learn meaning of the words, so distance isnt very accurate
- Somewhat solved by [Bag of n-grams](Bag of n-grams.md)
- [Curse Of Dimensionality](Curse Of Dimensionality.md)
