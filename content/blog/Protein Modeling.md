# Protein Modeling
- Using [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) models
- Task : Estimate [Probability](Probability.md) mass function(because discrete) for a finite, discrete distribution -> given a histogram from a sample
- Large number of categories and small number of observations

	- Estimate [Probability](Probability.md) distrib of amino acids in each column in a protein class. 20 dim [PMF](PMF.md) (one for each site)
	- Can be aligned
	- High chances of class not being present in data
		- [MLE](MLE) will assign 0 [Probability](Probability.md) to X
		- Wrong decision made for a lot of them that were not in the training set
		- Cannot use
- 20 dim [PMF](PMF.md) for amnio acid distrib : $\theta = (\theta_{1}, … ,\theta_{20})' = (P(X=A), …, P(X=Y))'$
	- count vectors of amino acids found in a given site in training data D
	- Distributed according to [Multinomial Distribution](Multinomial%20Distribution.md) with l = 20

## Using Prior
- 0 probabilities should not occur. $$\mathcal{H} = (\theta_{1}, …, \theta_{20})' \in \mathbb{R}^{20}|\theta_{j} \in (0,1)$$ and $$ \Sigma_{j} \theta_{j}=1$$
	- 19 dim hypervolume
	- Continuous space and so can use [PDF](PDF.md)
	- [Dirichlet Distribution](Dirichlet%20Distribution.md) is used to represent it because parameterized with l = 20

- $\alpha$s fixed beforehand
