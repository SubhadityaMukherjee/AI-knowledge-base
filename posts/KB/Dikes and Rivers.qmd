# Dikes and Rivers


- Subjects alternate producing time intervals of a short and a long duration.  
- Initially, short is 2 seconds and long is 3.1 seconds
- They receive feedback on whether their estimate is within +/- 12.5% of the target, and receive “too short” or “too long” as feedback otherwise.
- After a number of trials, the criterion for the long interval starts to change

- Short intervals are also effected and vice versa

## Model
- ACTR declarative memory + [Declarative Memory Blending](Declarative Memory Blending.qmd)
