# Associate AI Specialist Application - Subhaditya Mukherjee


As the days go by, Machine Learning and AI are slowly becoming terms that every company wants to have in their portfolio. While this drive leads to many innovations, most companies are not sure how to do AI "well". They want to use AI but need clarification on whether it is required, how to handle bias, how to create proper data, or even what models (ML vs. DL) to choose. The job of an AI specialist, then, is to provide the key information required to find and fulfil KPIs given any project. This job would be the perfect next step for me, and so I hope you give me a chance to work with you and your team.

My interest is at the intersection of applied AI and explainability, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. My masters thesis was on improving the explainability of vision models, which gave me quite a bit of experience in this domain. I am quite familiar with Python, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and other tricks of the trade. But this would be my first job, and I have a lot to learn as well. I am willing to put time and effort into learning new technologies and enabling more efficient AI integration with future clients.

The customer is king, they say, and the first step in having happy clients is understanding what they truly want and then being able to give them a solution they can use. I hope to be part of a team at PWC working on enabling stakeholders to implement responsible AI in their products.
