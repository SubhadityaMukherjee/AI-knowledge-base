# [Bayesian](Bayesian.qmd) Posterior
- When D is fixed though, this becomes a function of Model Candidates
- Non negative on K dim param space
- Not a [PDF](PDF.qmd) but if we divide it by its integral -> [PDF](PDF.qmd) .
	- $$\frac{p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^K}p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)d\theta}$$
	- Prob distrib over candidate models
- If the denominator is replaced written as $p(D)$ then it looks like the [Bayes Rule](Bayes%20Rule.qmd)
- Shape : $P(D|\theta)h(\theta)$
	- Integral not 1
	- [Proto Distributions](Proto%20Distributions.qmd) on $\theta$ space
