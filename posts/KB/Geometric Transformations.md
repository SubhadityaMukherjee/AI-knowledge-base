# Geometric Transformations
- The safety of a Data Augmentation method refers to its likelihood of preserving the label post-transformation.
- A non-label preserving transformation could potentially strengthen the model’s ability to output a response indicating that it is not confident about its prediction. However, achieving this would require refined labels post-augmentation.
- Due to the challenge of constructing refined labels for post-augmented data, it is important to consider the ‘safety’ of an augmentation. This is somewhat domain dependent
