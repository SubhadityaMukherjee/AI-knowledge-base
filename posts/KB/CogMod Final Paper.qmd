# CogMod Final Paper

- [The Reward Experiment](The Reward Experiment.qmd)
- An ACT-R model that explains at least one of these effects (well)  
- Report to justify design choices
- ‘cognitive’ interpretation, that is justifiable & plausible

## To test
- linear decrease in goal activation 

## Papers
- [Sequential effects within a short foreperiod context Evidence for the conditioning account of temporal preparation](Sequential effects within a short foreperiod context Evidence for the conditioning account of temporal preparation.qmd) : IMPORTANT
- [Traces of times past Representations of temporal intervals in memory](Traces of times past Representations of temporal intervals in memory.qmd) : Explain the fanning effect
- [The warning stimulus as retrieval cue The role of associative memory in temporal preparation](The warning stimulus as retrieval cue The role of associative memory in temporal preparation.qmd) : temporal preparation , sloping effects
- [Modeling motivation using goal competition in mental fatigue studies](Modeling motivation using goal competition in mental fatigue studies.qmd) : performance in reward vs non reward , distraction, linear decrease in goal activation
- [The neural correlates of mental fatigue and reward processing - A task-based fMRI study](The neural correlates of mental fatigue and reward processing - A task-based fMRI study.qmd) : studies the physical brain effect of reward and fatigue
- [Implicitly learning when to be ready - From instances to categories](Implicitly learning when to be ready - From instances to categories.qmd) : fanning , maybe the graphs can also be explained by categorical association instead of just instance based
- [On the Distinction Between Perceived Duration and Event Timing - Towards a Unified Model of Time Perception](On the Distinction Between Perceived Duration and Event Timing - Towards a Unified Model of Time Perception.qmd) : brain uses temporal expectations to bias perception in a way that stimuli are ‘regularized’
- [Change of Variable Foreperiod Effects within an Experiment - A Bayesian Modeling Approach](Change of Variable Foreperiod Effects within an Experiment - A Bayesian Modeling Approach.qmd) : sequential modulation, which is attributed to feature binding and retrieval by the BRAC framework, could have different underlying mechanisms depending on the task scenario.
