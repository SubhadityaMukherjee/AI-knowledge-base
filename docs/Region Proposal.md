# Region Proposal
- region proposal generation that shares full-image convolutional [[Features|features]] with the detection network,
- nearly cost-free region proposals
- haring convolutional [[Features|features]] with the down-stream detection network
- simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position
