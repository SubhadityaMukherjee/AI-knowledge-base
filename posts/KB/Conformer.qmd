# Conformer
- [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100)
- [Transformer](Transformer.qmd) models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local [features](Features.qmd) effectively
- integrating components from both CNNs and Transformers for end-to-end [speech recognition](speech recognition.qmd) to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way
- importance of each component, and demonstrated that the inclusion of convolution modules is critical to the performance of the Conformer model
- propose the convolution-augmented [transformer](Transformer.qmd) for [speech recognition](speech recognition.qmd), named Conformer
- [LibriSpeech](LibriSpeech.qmd)
