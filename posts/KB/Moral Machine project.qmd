- studying the perception of autonomous vehicles (AVs) which are controlled by AI and has the potential to harm pedestrians and/or passengers if they malfunction
- allows participants to judge various ethical dilemmas facing AVs which have malfunctioned, and select which outcomes they prefer.

- protecting passengers
- upholding the law
