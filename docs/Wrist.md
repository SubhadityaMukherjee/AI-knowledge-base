# Wrist
- A set of rotary joints between the arm and the robot [end-effector](End-effector.md) that allow the [end-effector](End-effector.md) to be oriented to the work-piece. In most cases the wrist can have [degrees of freedom](Degrees%20of%20Freedom.md) which enable it to grasp an object with [roll](Roll.md), pitch, and [yaw](Yaw.md) orientation.
