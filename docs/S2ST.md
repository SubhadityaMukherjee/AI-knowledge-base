# S2ST
- [Direct Speech-to-speech Translation with Discrete Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05604)
- direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) model that translates speech from one language to speech in another language without relying on intermediate text generation
- self-supervised discrete speech encoder on the target speech
- training a sequence-to-sequence speech-to-unit translation
- model to predict the discrete representations of the target speech
- When target text transcripts are available, they design a joint speech and text training framework that enables the model to generate dual modality output (speech and text) simultaneously in the same inference pass
