# Logarithm


- Logarithms are sort of a measure of the “bigness” of a number; 1–10 is small (say, 0..1), 10–100 are medium (1..2), 100–1000 are big (2..3). But, it makes a pretty huge difference if we’re thinking about $log(x)$ with $x$ between 1 and 10, or with $x$ above 10, or with $x$ less than 1. An $x$ between zero and 1 turns into a negative number
