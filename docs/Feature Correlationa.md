# Feature Correlationa
```toc
```

- If certain features in a dataset have a high correlation in a dataset, it becomes difficult to control specific features without changing the closely correlated ones.
- For example, let's say you have a dataset of Â face images and want to add facial hair to an image of a woman, it's likely that you'll end up modifying more features as this feature is highly correlated with a male's face.
