# Possion Distribution
- [[Probability]] that an event occurs k times within a given time interval
- Eg:
- k meteors within 100 years
- k calls in an hour
- Also can count spatially circumscribed events
- no of dust particles in a mm of air
- no of diamons in ton of ore
- Expected no of events $E[X]$ : rate $\lambda$
- [[PMF]] : $$p(k) = \frac{\lambda^{k}e^{-k}}{k!}$$
- ![[assets/Pasted image 20220319133622.png|im]]
- Eg:
- N 1-hour protocols for calls : $n_{i} (i = 1, â€¦, N)$
- $$\hat\lambda =\frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i}n_{i}$$
