# Wide Deep Recommender
- [Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792)
- Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs.
- Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort
- However, memorization and generalization are both important for recommender systems.
- With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse [features](Features.qmd)
- However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank.
- jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks – to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems
- Wide linear models can effectively memorize sparse feature interactions using cross-product feature transformations, while deep neural networks can generalize to previously unseen feature interactions through low dimensional embeddings
- In other words, the fusion of wide and deep models combines the strengths of memorization and generalization, and provides us with better recommendation systems
- The two models are trained jointly with the same [loss](loss.qmd) function.
