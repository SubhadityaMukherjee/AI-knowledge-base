# Forgetting
- If our memories are too precise and overfitted, then we can't actually use them to make predictions about future situations
- Forgetting is an essential component of adaptive system
- Simple memories that store the gist of our experiences and avoid complicated details will be better for generalizing to future events.
- orgetting has been regarded as a passive decay over time of the information stored in the memory.

## Passive Forgetting
- Concepts stored in the memory can be forgotten "passively" based on: Decay over time (fading factor)
- Loss of context cue
- Retrieval interference

## Active Forgetting
- may be more potent at erasing memory than the passive forgetting mechanisms Motivated forgetting
- forgetting is often more intentional
- unpleasant memories (categories) Intrinsic forgetting
- redundant data Interference-based forgetting samples that cause interference
