# Schipol Data Scientist
```toc
```


- Bonus:
	- Have experience with computer vision.
	- Have knowledge about cloud computing
 - Work on scaling up our DeepTurnaround product to a multi-airport product.
- Continuous monitoring, development and optimization of our state-of-the-art Computer Vision model.
- Develop and implement new technical features.
- Work within a skilled development product team consisting of multiple data scientists, data engineers and full stack developers.
- And… work at a cool location where you will see aircrafts passing by your window. 
- By leveraging our AI systems, we generate detections from camera images in real-time to capture events occurring around the aircraft. Ultimately, our aim is to enhance the decision-making process in operations, leading to a reduction in delays and CO2 emissions.

## Motivation

- DeepTurnaround 
	- The turnaround process is a series of tasks that need to be completed from the time an aircraft arrives at the assigned gate until it is ready for departure - A large scale optimization process
	- Useful tech, saves time, money and makes the Schipol experience even better for travellers
	- Impact of work
	- Guess how it works 
		- Object detection for individual cases
		- combined data from two cameras
	- Potential ideas for improvement
		- In the future, we expect to include features which can benefit safety and sustainability officers/managers as well. - Thesis on XAI
		- Perhaps a third camera/ for more personell focused view, even more fine grained control. (Eg. Uniforms, crowd density )
	- Computer Vision + Datascience
		- Perfect mix of things where I can contribute to
		- experience

## Recruiter Email
- Resume sent through the process
- Is this position still open?
- Just finished a masters in AI from RUG.
- DeepTurnaround - have many ideas to contribute and work with implementing for a better airport experience at either Schipol or other customers

## Motivation Letter

Hello!

This is Subhaditya Mukherjee. I graduated from the University of Groningen with a masters in Artificial Intelligence last month and just started looking for a job here in the Netherlands. My area of expertise and interest is a combination of Computer Vision and Data Analytics, which is what this position is about. 

I enjoy traveling and am familiar with how frustrating airports can be on a long journey. But there are hundreds of moving parts, and even finding analytics for the same can be a challenge. Deep Turnaround is a very interesting project to me for this reason. The website does not state many technical details, but it seems that the system is a combination of custom data collection, fine-grained object detection networks, and data analytics, each of which must be quite challenging, given the scope of the task. 

That being said, I have some ideas that could make Deep Turnaround even more useful to our stakeholders, and I would love to discuss and work on them to help make the airport experience a little more streamlined. Of course, I would be willing to work on any other feature that is proposed. These are just some ideas. (These might be already implemented, but I did not see these labels in the video on the website). One of the first ideas that comes to mind is using the two existing cameras to also analyze crowd information to make the passenger experience more streamlined and avoid chaos while boarding. Or perhaps, collecting pictures of worker uniforms would enable Deep Turnaround to log more specific events. Neither of these would require any extra infrastructure costs, which is probably also one of your constraints. 

My previous internships and projects (both personal and freelance) have included Deep Object Detection, Computer Vision, Data warehousing and analytics, and Dashboarding. These experiences will let me contribute to any AI team, and I am willing to learn whatever else is necessary for any future projects.

I have a lot to learn, and I want to work with a team that is making a real-world impact in a sector close to my heart like this one. It is not every day you find a position that you enjoy and also think you can contribute something to, and I sincerely hope you give me a chance!

Thank you,
Subhaditya Mukherjee
