# Big-Bench
- [Beyond the Imitation Game: Quantifying and Extrapolating the Capabilities of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615)
- present and near-future capabilities and limitations of [language](language.md) models
- Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench)
- benchmark that can measure progress well beyond the current state-of-the-art
- 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions
- Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development
- tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current [language](language.md) models
- valuate the behavior of OpenAIâ€™s [GPT](GPT.md) models, Google-internal dense [Transformer](Transformer.md) architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters
