# CogMod Final Paper

- [[The Reward Experiment]]
- An ACT-R model that explains at least one of these effects (well)  
- Report to justify design choices
- ‘cognitive’ interpretation, that is justifiable & plausible

## To test
- linear decrease in goal activation 

## Papers
- [[Sequential effects within a short foreperiod context Evidence for the conditioning account of temporal preparation]] : IMPORTANT
- [[Traces of times past Representations of temporal intervals in memory]] : Explain the fanning effect
- [[The warning stimulus as retrieval cue The role of associative memory in temporal preparation]] : temporal preparation , sloping effects
- [[Modeling motivation using goal competition in mental fatigue studies]] : performance in reward vs non reward , distraction, linear decrease in goal activation
- [[The neural correlates of mental fatigue and reward processing - A task-based fMRI study.md|The neural correlates of mental fatigue and reward processing - A task-based fMRI study]] : studies the physical brain effect of reward and fatigue
- [[Implicitly learning when to be ready - From instances to categories]] : fanning , maybe the graphs can also be explained by categorical association instead of just instance based
- [[On the Distinction Between Perceived Duration and Event Timing - Towards a Unified Model of Time Perception]] : brain uses temporal expectations to bias perception in a way that stimuli are ‘regularized’
- [[Change of Variable Foreperiod Effects within an Experiment - A Bayesian Modeling Approach.md|Change of Variable Foreperiod Effects within an Experiment - A Bayesian Modeling Approach]] : sequential modulation, which is attributed to feature binding and retrieval by the BRAC framework, could have different underlying mechanisms depending on the task scenario.
- [[Revisiting variable foreperiod effects evaluating the repetition priming account]] : change in foreperiod
