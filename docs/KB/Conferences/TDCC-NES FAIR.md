# TDCC-NES FAIR
```toc
```
- 22 may 25
## Funding Guidelines
- NES : Natural and engineering sciences
- around ~800k/yr, collaborative funding
- If you either agree on a similar community or have your own ideas
- Should have a short term vision + longer term
- Show that you will affect the international and inter disciplinary communities
- Show that you will be involving the research community in the project (community building)
- Identify your stakeholders
- Try not to have an extremely (domain) specific vision
- Try to involve multiple institutions
- Funding will not be approved if it is used to "maintain" existing software, you should show you are doing something new
- Deadline : 13th June
- Full proposal by september
- Somwhat related to our topic
	- Modelers Community 
		- FAIR for models
		- Open modelers foundation
		- Dr G.M Hengeveld , LTER-LIFE , NIOO-KNAW (should get an email)
		- We mainly discussed how we can organize a community of modellers that can serve as umbrella to organize specific topical exchanges.
## Panel on FAIR Research Practises
- 4TU : connecting research data etc from across the 4TUs in NL
- Challenges
	- There is awareness about FAIR but people do not know how to achieve it
	- There is a lack of urgency and initiatives 
	- There is a lack of "rewards and recognition"
	- Focus on quantity vs quality
	- Astronomy
		- Large data infrastructures exist
		- Interoperable
		- But now old and out of date
	- There are too many metadata standards
	- Open data is not really there yet
	- Not always easy to find the code
	- Sharing all kinds of data is too hard
	- Version control is not really there yet
	- Researchers usually use FAIR either at the project planning stage or at the end of their research => We should "catch them in the middle"
	- The pressure to succeed in your tenure
		- Forced to be less open
		- Publish first
	- Acoustics, martin (tu/e)
		- Publications focus too much on the wrong thing
		- there is no impact of software
		- Only DBs are connected but not much else
		- executive boards should be involved
	- people see social safety as noise
	- if you impose too much on the researchers, they won't do it
	- researchers think someone else will do it for them

## Pitches/Demos
### Knowledge Graph to Organize Scientific Research
- Tailored forming
- hard to find information from a literature review
- open research KB
	- They already got a permanent grant to maintain this project
- structured KB using templates for things
- focus on content more vs metadata
- LLM + KB (graph)
- they provide a data ontology you follow (semi-automated)
### Catalizing Plant Information Using Community Driven KB
- Didnt understand much here since it was very bio-tech focused
- Plants are the best chemists
	- Too many interactions between them
	- paired omics data
- research is too scattered
- community led prioritization
- computational metabolomics
### Transparency in Regularity and compliance (TU/e)
- Data provenance
- Planning and sharing data
- data management plan - you don't see it after the start, they want you to
- Some sort of live document thingie for all this
- Links together data, software publications, data management plan, compliance information etc
- DMP -> ERB -> Impact assesment -> DPIA
	- (I forgot what these mean :/)
### Bottleneck Project in Sustainibility
- Previously got this grant
- Gave tips on what to look out for
	- Sustainibility and preservation of project
	- make sure you have money
	- make sure the project leader has time
	- make sure you have support, proper timelines
	- enough manpower
### Data Producing and Reuse
- LLM to tailor metadata
### Researcher Journey Framework
- well, what the name says
### ⁠local Al Support
- open data
### ⁠Enhance HPC & Cloud Skills
- training
- Open source workshop material 
### Unify Transposon Database
- community ontology for transposons
### The Turing way
- ⁠reusable community resource (exists in america)
- Coordinated effort for NL
### Awesome Github Repositories
- Awesome list for NES by subtopic
### 3D Time Resolved X-ray Tomography
### Open Source Citation Entailement Checker
### Cultivating a Code Review Culture
- Peer reviewed manual code review
### Standardized Vibe Coder
- Standardize vibe coding by using…more vibes 
- vibes = LLM
### Open Hardware Cooperation
- collaborative cooperation in hardware design
### Sustainable Resource Software Development
- [Code auditor](https://github.com/SS-NES/code-auditor)
	- tool that does what the name says (to an extent)
- Software is a key research output
- interoperability and reuse are important
- software changes too rapidly
- templates for research
- licenses 
- citations
- unit testing
- conformity checks are nice to have
- checking tools
