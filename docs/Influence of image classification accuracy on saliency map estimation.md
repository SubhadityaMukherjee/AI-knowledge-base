# Influence of Image Classification Accuracy on Saliency Map Estimation
- @oyamaInfluenceImageClassification2018.
## Intro
- Saliency map estimation in computer vision aims to estimate the locations where people gaze in images.
- Since people tend to look at objects in images, the parameters of the model pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification are useful for the saliency map estimation
- no research on the relationship between the image classification accuracy and the performance of the saliency map estimation
- strong correlation between image classification accuracy and saliency map estimation accuracy
- It the models pre-trained on ImageNet are useful for saliency map estimation the parameters of is known that
- This would be because a human tends to look at the centres of objects , which are learned to be recognised in the pre-trained model for the ImageNet classification task.
- Although the model based on DenseNet has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in the ACPR 2017 paper, this additional study led to even better performance using the model based on dual path networks (DPNs)

## Components of Readout Net
- The operation attempts to directly minimise the reconstruction error of the input image under a [[sparsity]] constraint on an over-complete set of feature maps
- The mini-batch size and learning rate were set to 1 and 10−5 during training, respectively.
- We subtract the per-channels mean value of training images from each image as pre-processing
### DC
- "DC is also called as transposed convolution"
- When DC is used for the up-sampling layers in Readout Net, the first, second, and third DC followed by a ReLU layer in Readout Net reduce the channels to 128, 64, and 32, respectively. Then, the 1 × 1 convolution reduces the channel to 1 to predict the saliency map. The filter size of DC was set to 4 × 4.
- method to recover a high-resolution image from its additional low resolution counterpart with little computational cost, by rearranging the data along the channel into feature maps with a convolution operation.
### SPC
- When SPC is used for the up-sampling layers, each SPC layer reduces the channels to one forth, followed by a 3 × 3 convolution and a ReLU layer. Then, the 1 × 1 convolution predicts the saliency map from the output of the last SPC layer.
- each BI layer in the up-sampling network resizes a feature map twice while maintaining the feature-map channels, GPU was out of memory when three up-sampling layers were used for all channels of outputs of Main Net
### BI
- the order of up-sampling and projection (1 × 1 convolution) can be inverted without any influence on the output
- the concatenated feature maps from Main Nets are first processed by the 1 × 1 convolution to output feature map, followed by the BI up-sampling layers. the 1-channel

## Conclusions
- strong correlation between image classification accuracy and saliency map estimation accuracy.
- not only the architecture but also the initialisation strategy using the weights pre-trained with the ImageNet classification task were important for estimating the saliency maps
- model which is pre-trained with the ImageNet classification and has achieved high
- "for performance on the classification task is also useful the"
- "saliency map estimation task"
- human fixations often concentrate on objects in the image, while the model pre-trained on ImageNet can react on many objects in images because ImageNet has a wide variety of object categories.
- If the model is initialised with random weights and is trained on a fixation dataset with the limited categories of objects for saliency map estimation, to the objects in the training dataset the model would overfit
- if the model is trained for the image classification task which includes a wide variety of categories, overfitting for the objects in the training dataset would be suppressed owing to a large number of categories.
