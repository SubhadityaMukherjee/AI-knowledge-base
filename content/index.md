## About This Blog
- This is my little knowledge base
- If there is something you are looking for, just type it into the search bar

	- In essence, it will have something on things that I learn
- How to go about finding things?
	- Scroll the sidebar and pick something you like. Click the links inside it to go about. Choose your own adventure.
