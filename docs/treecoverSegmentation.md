# Tree Cover Segmentation
- treecover segmentation [PointNet++](PointNet++.md)
	- Data collected from above
	- Normalization : height, xy
	- Rotation
	- Jiggling ??
	- Labeling
		- ![im](assets/Pasted%20Image%2020220318094643.png) Segmentation algorithm. Canopy hide model
		- Weighted loss + [Focal Loss](Focal%20Loss.md)
## 2d Methods
- [Watershed](Watershed) + [Unet](Unet.md)
