# Memory-based Learning
- Lazy learning
- All encountered examples are stored in memory in a multi-dimensional array, positioned according to relevant features
- New items are classified (comprehension) or generated (production) by searching for an example in memory that is closest to the target
- Because examplars are represented by their features even novel forms can be classified
- A generalization of the knn (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm
- Don't remove any infrequent or even solo forms. You might need the info
- Don't trim down the number of examples of a frequent form you have in the model. This effects it.
- Learning is storing, classification is analogy
- multiple long-distance dependencies
