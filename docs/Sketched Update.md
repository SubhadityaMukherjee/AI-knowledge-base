# Sketched Update
- Learn a full model update, then compress it before sending to the server.
- First computes the full Hit during local training without any constraints, and then approximates, or encodes, the update in a (lossy) compressed form before sending to the server. The server decodes the updates before doing the aggregation. 
- Subsampling - Instead of sending Hit , each client only communicates matrix HÌ‚it which is formed from a random subset of the (scaled) values of Hit.
- Quantize the weights -Improving the quantization by structured random rotations. The above 1-bit and multi-bit quantization approach work best when the scales are approximately equal across different dimensions.
- In the decoding phase, the server needs to perform the inverse rotation before aggregating all the updates.
