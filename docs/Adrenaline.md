# Adrenaline
- Also called epinephrine, this hormone is secreted by the [[Adrenal Glands|adrenal glands]] in response to stress and other challenges to the body. The release of adrenaline causes a number of changes throughout the body, including the metabolism of carbohydrates to supply the bodyâ€™s energy demands and increased arousal or alertness.
