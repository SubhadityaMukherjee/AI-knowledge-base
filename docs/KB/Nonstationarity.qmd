# Nonstationarity
- A feature whose values change across one or more dimensions, usually time. For example, the number of swimsuits sold at a particular store demonstrates nonstationarity because that number varies with the season. As a second example, the quantity of a particular fruit harvested in a particular region typically shows sharp nonstationarity over time.
