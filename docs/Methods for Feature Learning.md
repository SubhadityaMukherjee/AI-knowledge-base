# Methods for [Feature Learning](Feature%20Learning.md)
- Start with a random dict and rep. Update D while keeping r fixed -> find best r while keeping D fixed. Repeat until convergence.
- Move D in a direction to minimize loss and project it back
	- [Gradient Descent gradients](Gradient%20Descent%20gradients.md) or [LinearRegression](LinearRegression.md)
