# Structural Risk Minimization
- An algorithm that balances two goals
	- The desire to build the most predictive model (for example, lowest loss).
	- The desire to keep the model as simple as possible (for example, strong regularization).
	- or example, a function that minimizes loss+regularization on the training set is a structural risk minimization algorithm.
