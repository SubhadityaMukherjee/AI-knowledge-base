    <description>Color Space Transformations Image data is encoded into 3 stacked matrices, each of size height×width. These matrices represent pixel values for an individual RGB color value Lighting biases are amongst the most frequently occurring challenges to image recognition problems A quick fix to overly bright or dark images is to loop through the images and decrease or increase the pixel values by a constant value.</description>

    <description>Collectivity, Distributivity, and the Interpretation of Plural Numerical Expressions in Child and Adult Language Kristen Syrett, Ph.D. and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Linguistics, New Brunswick, United States Julien Musolino : Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Psychology, Piscataway, United States Intro Sentences containing plural numerical expressions (e.g., two boys) can give rise to two interpretations (collective and distributive), arising from the fact that their representation admits of a part-whole structure designed to explore children’s understanding of this distinction and its implications for the acquisition of linguistic expressions with number words.</description>
