# Pick and Place Cycle
- The amount of time it takes for a [[Manipulator|manipulator]] to pick up an object and place it in a desired location, then return to its rest position. This includes time during the acceleration and deceleration phases of a particular task. The robot movement is controlled from one point location in space to another in a [[Point-to-Point]] (PTP) motion system. Each point is programmed into the robot's control memory and then played back during the work cycle.
