# Pomodoro : A Means but not the End 

In our quest for productivity, many ideas, tools, and theories have sprung up over the ages. Some work, some don’t, and some are versions of previous ones with a “modern” twist. The concept of the Pomodoro timer seems to have stood the test of time. The hustle culture especially has glorified its existence and made it out to be something of a magic pill that either works for you or does absolutely nothing. 
I think it is a very valuable tool. But in time, we have stopped thinking of it as a tool and made it out to be more of a rule. 
So how do we make it work for us?

(Disclaimer - I am no self-help productivity guru. This works for me, and I share it in the hopes that it helps someone else. Don’t take my words as a golden rule.)

## A definition
Before we move further it is my habit to define the terms we work with. A Pomodoro timer, in its essence, is a combination of time blocking and scheduling rest periods. It has “cycles” that are combinations of a 25-minute deep work session followed by a 5-minute break. After four such cycles, a longer break of 45 minutes can be taken.
In theory, it does sound pretty good. So why is it that it doesn’t work for so many of us?

## Why does it fail
I think there are a few simple reasons why it might not work for you. Which one(s) is(are) it for you?
- You try sticking to the 25-5-25-5.. timing, but it just doesn’t work.
- You start one, but something comes up in between and then it just doesn’t work.
- You think it should give you hours of focus, and when it doesn’t, you decide to just use something else instead.
- The breaks are not timed right.
- You end up constantly looking at the timer and it is way too distracting.

Sounds like you? Welcome to the club. Something else? Let me know in the comments. Either way, let’s make it work for us.

## Redefining our objective
I believe that the common theme we face with using the Pomodoro, or honestly any other productivity technique is that we put too many expectations on it. At the end of the day, it’s just a tool. The ability to use a tool depends on who wields it. 
Our objective is not to work for long long hours. It is to focus, and get into an undistracted state where you are deeply concentrated on getting whatever you have to do, done. A “flow state” if you want to use a trendy term. 
Pomodoro can help there. But only if you let it.

## How I use it
Indeed, that was a pretty long-winded introduction to something rather simple. I use it as a means to get started. I don’t think I have ever completed a “cycle” recently. But almost every time, it does help me set the tone for my work session of the day.
As of writing this article, I had a Pomodoro of 30 minutes going. After that initial time, I think I spent about an hour more. I didn’t check on the timer then. I just sat down and finished my writing for the morning.

But, as it goes, this is not perfect. In time I have noticed a few factors that make or break my session.
- Planning. If I don’t plan out my work for the day, and just get started, nothing I do works. I’m still too distracted even with the timer on. I like to block off times for work on a calendar and try my best to stick to them. 
- Changing the timings. A 30 - 5 - 30 … timing works for me when it comes to longer running tasks. Sometimes, a task I pick is more challenging and I end up adjusting the breaks to give me some more rest.
- Breaks are subjective. There is no way for Pomodoro to know what you are working on. If the break comes when you are way too focused and working hard, skip it. Take it later though. Add them up.
- Finding your productive times. To make use of the timer, try to find the general times in a day that you have more mental clarity and headspace. For me, it’s earlier in the day. And maybe a few hours in the evening. I do have to say that, these times aren’t fixed in stone. Pick what works for you.
- Start with a completed task. I find the satisfaction of finishing something very motivating. I have noticed that if the first task you do in your work session is something you know for sure that you can complete, it does set the tone for the rest of the time. Try ordering your work that way.
- Play around with the timings. With some experimentation, you will find one that works for you.
- Don’t stick with it. Ironic, I know. Use it to start and then do what you need to.

This article is in the hopes that it will help someone out. Maybe have the help that I did not. I do not know who it will reach. But to whoever it does, best of luck :)
