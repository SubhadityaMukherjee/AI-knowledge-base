# Word Vectors
- Essentially word [Embedding](Embedding.md)
- Text processing
- We can represent ideas/sentences/documents as vectors to feed into any kind of model
- Useful because vectors can be easily compared to find similarity
	- eg : [Cosine Similarity](Cosine Similarity.md)
- Higher dimensions make it challenging

- Vectors that are metrically close to each other
- [GloVE](GloVE.md)
