# Benchmark LLM
- [[A Benchmark for LLMs on Planning and Reasoning about Change)](A Benchmark for LLMs on Planning and Reasoning about Change|Large Language Models Still Canâ€™t Plan (A Benchmark for LLMs on Planning and Reasoning about Change)]])
- The recent advances in large [[language]] models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural [[language]] processing (NLP)
- From [[GPT3]] to [[PaLM]], the state-of-the-art performance on natural [[language]] tasks is being pushed forward with every new large [[language]] model
- current benchmarks are relatively simplistic and the performance over these benchmarks cannot be used as an evidence to support
- extensible assessment framework motivated by the above gaps in current benchmarks to test the abilities of LLMs on a central aspect of human intelligence, which is reasoning about actions and change
- multiple test cases
