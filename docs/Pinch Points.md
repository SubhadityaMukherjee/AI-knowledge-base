# Pinch Points
- A pinch point is any point at which it is possible for a person or part of a person’s body to be caught between moving parts of a machine, or between the moving and stationary parts of a machine, or between material and any part of the machine. A pinch point does not have to cause injury to a limb or body part, although it might cause injury – it only has to trap or pinch the person to prevent them from escaping or removing the trapped part from the pinch point.
