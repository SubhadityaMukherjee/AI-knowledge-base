# Isotropic Architectures
- (of an object or substance) having a physical property which has the same value when measured in different directions.
- And precisely that is what an isotropic architecture is. Isotropic architectures do not produce pyramid shaped data transformations, but rather _fixed_ ones where data does not change in shape and size
- In other (simpler) words, when you take a look at the value going through an _isotropic_ network, it doesn't change in size.
- Like [[Transformer]] , [[MLP-Mixer]]
