# Research Engineer in Human Modeling for Automated Driving - Subhaditya Mukherjee


As AI gets more advanced, applications such as automated driving become more feasible. But the real challenge is ensuring responsible and reliable implementations of algorithms with a safety-first mindset. That being the case, I am quite interested in contributing to research in this domain. I remember working on a similar project in my bachelors with a startup for a little bit, but sadly, COVID-19 put a halt to their operations, and I could not continue with them. The work was quite interesting though, and I was sad about losing the opportunity back then. So, when this position showed up in my search, I did not want to miss out again.

As of a month ago, I have a masters in AI from the University of Groningen, which now also puts me in a better position to tackle the challenges faced in developing these models. My interest is at the intersection of applied AI and explainability, and I am quite familiar with Python, deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and other tricks of the trade. Interestingly enough, I also enjoy teaching and was a TA for three courses in my masters as well. While I bring programming, AI and computer vision skills to the table, I am willing to learn whatever else is required for the project. I firmly believe in human-in-the-loop solutions to life-critical problems such as this one, and I can also contribute to the explainability and fairness of the system. 

I believe that this position would be the perfect next step for me as it not only is a project with real-world impact, but also involves quite a bit of interdisciplinary research. I hope you give me a chance, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you,
Subhaditya Mukherjee
