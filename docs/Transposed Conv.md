# Transposed Conv
```toc
```
- use a transformation going in the opposite direction of a normal convolution, i.e., from something that has the shape of the output of some convolution to something that has the shape of its input while maintaining a connectivity pattern that is compatible with said convolution.
- Upsampling
- Input i, kernel k, padding p, stride s , $$o = (i-1) \times s +k -2p$$
- Steps
	- Calculate new Param's z and p'
	- Between each row and columns of the input, insert z number of zeros. This increases the size of the input to $(2*i -1) \times (2*i -1)$
	- Pad the modified image with p' no of zeros
	- Standard conv with stride of 1
