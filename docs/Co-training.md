# Co-training
- A semi-supervised learning approach particularly useful when all of the following conditions are true
- The ratio of unlabeled examples to labeled examples in the dataset is high.
- This is a classification problem (binary or multi-class).
- The dataset contains two different sets of predictive features that are independent of each other and complementary.
- Co-training essentially amplifies independent signals into a stronger signal.
