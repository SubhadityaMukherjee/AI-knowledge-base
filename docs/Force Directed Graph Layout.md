# [[Force]] Directed Graph Layout
- Model a graph as rings and springs
- Attractive forces between adjacent nodes
- edges are modeled as springs with uniform length
- Repulsive forces between non-adjacent nodes could be seen as springs of infinite length or repelling forces of electrically charged metal spheres
