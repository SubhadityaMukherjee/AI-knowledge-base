# Data Augmentation with Curriculum Learning
- Curriculum learning decisions are especially important for One-Shot Learning systems such as FaceNet
- In this sense, the concept of curriculum learning shares many similarities with adversarial search algorithms or learning only on hard examples.
- originally coined by Bengio et al.
- Plotting out training accuracy over time across different initial training subsets could help reveal patterns in the data that dramatically speed up training time.
