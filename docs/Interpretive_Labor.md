# Interpretive Labor
- There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it.
- On one extreme, the explainer can painstakingly craft a beautiful explanation, leading their audience to understanding without even realizing it could have been difficult
- On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle.
- That is, really outstanding tutorials, reviews, textbooks, and so on.
- we often have a group of researchers all trying to understand each other
- Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member
- At some size, the effort to understand everyone else becomes too much.
- As a defense mechanism, people specialize, focusing on a narrower area of interest.
- The maintainable size of the field is controlled by how its members trade off the energy between communicating and understanding.
- [Research debt](Research_Debt.md) is the accumulation of missing interpretive labor.
- It’s extremely natural for young ideas to go through a stage of debt, like early prototypes in engineering.
- The problem is that we often stop at that point.
- Young ideas aren’t ending points for us to put in a paper and abandon.
- When we let things stop there the debt piles up.
- It becomes harder to understand and build on each other’s work and the field fragments.
