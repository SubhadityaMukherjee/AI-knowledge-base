# Main Day
- **12:41** Okay so here we are again. yesterday was a nice break. Today I want to finish a first draft of CCN. It is almost 1. But maybe in an hour I should have a skeleton of the draft ready.
	- 2-4 pages
	- Title
		- Short term distraction on the internet and functional brain networks : A task-related FMRI study
		- Short term distraction on the internet and it's effects on functional brain networks
		- Effects of intermittent social media distraction on functional brain networks
			- Yeah I am leaning towards this one here
	- Participants
		- An ideal number of participants would be atleast 10 for each of the two groups. (One with pages of a similar nature to the task, and another without) 
		- !!!!! Okay maybe send them an email asking for how long this actually takes
		- For every group, the participants are divided into age brackets 18-20, 21-39, 40-50+. The brackets were chosen based on the common scale of teen, adult, middle age. Since the objective is to see a general trend and not specifically focus on age groups, the author believes this to be a decent criterion.
		- The participants would be chosen based on the PIUQ survey and broadly classified into categories that are addicted to the internet and those that are not. 
		- **01:14** The participants are further divided into two groups. Each group of 10, would have atleast 2 from each age bracket.
		- Further funding would enable a more comprehensive study with more people from each age bracket.
	- Data Collected (Renamed at **01:24** )
		- From the task software, the accuracy achieved, along with the time to finish the task would be collected. From the fMRI data, the BOLD responses at the regions of the DMN and ICN would be collected as a timeseries. These would further be chunked into data from before and after the distraction was induced. Combining these sources of information for every individual, it would be possible to find that patterns that we are looking for. 
		- Once the data is obtained, standard preprocessing steps would first be applied to the fMRI data (denoising, removing faulty data, removing outliers, normalizing). The task data will also be checked for outliers.
	- Analysis Performed
		- The analysis would be performed for every individual. It would later split into the age brackets and internet addiction categories (since this is just a few simple data aggregations). The activations of the DMN and ICN from before and after the distraction would be compared. Care would be taken to ignore the time that the participant would require to get used to their environment. Special focus would be given to the performance in the moments right after the distraction. It would also be interesting to note if the performance increases after a span of time after they start doing the task again.

## Dump Task List
- Remove the weird art reference thing that we started yesterday I guess. Or not. Im not sure. Maybe i will keep that as a notes folder. Hmm. If i delete the papers from there (which is a good idea tbh), this is actually feasible
- vim how to use without breaking fingers lol
