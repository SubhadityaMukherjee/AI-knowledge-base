- [Generative Spoken Dialogue Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16502)
- dGSLM
- first “textless” model able to generate audio samples of naturalistic spoken dialogues
- unsupervised spoken unit discovery coupled with a dual-tower [[Transformer|transformer]] architecture with cross-[[Attention|attention]] trained on 2000 hours of two-channel raw conversational audio [[Fisher Spanish-English]] without any text or labels
- generate speech, laughter and other paralinguistic signals in the two channels simultaneously and reproduces naturalistic turn taking
