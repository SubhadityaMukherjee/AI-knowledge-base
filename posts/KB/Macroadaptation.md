# Macroadaptation


- Among four common designs for outer loops, the most complex is based on a pedagogy called macroadaptation (Corbett & Anderson, 1995; Shute, 1993)
- For each task that the tutoring system can assign, it knows which knowledge components are exercised by the task. For each [Knowledge Component](Knowledge%20Component.md), the tutor maintains an estimate of the student's degree of mastery of that [Knowledge Component](Knowledge%20Component.md)
- When a student has completed a task and the tutor needs to select the next one, it chooses one based on the overlap between the tasks' knowledge components and the student's mastered knowledge components
- For example, it might assign a task that requires many knowledge components that are already mastered by the student and just two components that are not yet mastered.
- Some tutoring systems represent not only correct and incorrect knowledge components, but also other stable traits of students. They might represent learning styles and preferences, such as a preference for visual or verbal explanations, so they can choose tasks that are marked as compatible with the student's style or preference.
- For the outer loop to function correctly across multiple tasks and sessions, the information about the student must be stored on a server or on the student's computer's disk. This persistent information is often called a student model. Exactly what it contains depends on the type of outer loop
