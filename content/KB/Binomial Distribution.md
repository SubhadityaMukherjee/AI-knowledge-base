# Binomial Distribution
- [[Bernoulli Distribution]] repeated for N independant trials with success [[Probability]] q
- Aka N times with only 2 outcomes
- [[PMF]]: $$p(s) = \binom{N}{s}q^{s}(1-q)^{N-s} = \frac{N!}{s!(N-s)}q^{s}(1-q)^{N-s}$$
- s = 0,1,2..N
- $N\choose s$ is binomial coefficient
- $$X \sim Bi(N,s)$$
