# Bayesian Model Estimation
- Unlike frequentist, sometimes things like sample mean is not a good metric because it has a high variance. Might give different results with different trials in a real valued distribution
- The task is to estimate $\theta$ from the data
- Use prior knowledge as beliefs (param vectors $\theta$). Cast in the form of a probability distribution over the space $\Theta$ .  -> **PRIOR DISTRIBUTION**
	- Weak knowledge most times
	- For a K parametric pdf $p_{x}$ , $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ . 
	- Not connected to Random variable(RVS). 
	- Does not model outcomes. Instead has "beliefs" about true distribution $P_{X_{i}}$
	- Each $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{K}$ corresponds to one specific pdf $p_{X}(\theta)$ -> single candidate distribution $\hat P_{X}$  for values $x_i$ (In frequentist, it models single data points)
	- Since this is a distribution over distributions, it is a hyperdistribution
	- N dim pdf $p_{\otimes}x_{i}: \mathbb{R}^{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$  for the distribution of $RV \otimes_{i}X_{i}$ 
		- $p_{\otimes_{i}}x_{i}((x_{i},…, x_{N})) = p_{x_{1}}, …, p_{x_{N}}(x_{N}) = \Pi_{i}p_{X}(x_{i})$
		- $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)$ -> pdf values on a data sample D $p_{\otimes_{i}}x_{i}((x_{i},…, x_{N})) = p_{\otimes_{i}}(\theta)(D)$
	- When $\theta$ is fixed then $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)$  is a function of data vectors D. For each sample, it describes how probable this distribution is assuming the true distribution of X is $p_{X}(\theta)$
	- When D is fixed, then it is a function of $\theta$. But this does not really measure anything.
		- Integral over $\theta$ is not 1
		- It is a function of $\theta$ and so it is a likelihood function. [[MLE]]
		- If given data D -> it can show which models are more likely than others.
		- Higher values of	$p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)$  are better

- Now there are two sources of info about the true distribution $p_{X}(\theta)$
	- The likelihood $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)$  of $\theta$
	- Prior plausibility in $h(\theta)$
	- Since these are independant sources we can combine them by multiplication: $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)$ 
		- High values -> Candidate model $\theta$ is a good estimate
	- When D is fixed though, this becomes a function of Model Candidates
	- Non negative on K dim param space
	- Not a pdf but if we divide it by its integral -> pdf . **POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION**
		- $$\frac{p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^K}p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)d\theta}$$
