# Centrifugal Force
- When a body rotates about an axis other than one at it's center of mass, it exerts an outward radial force called centrifugal force upon the axis, which restrains it from moving in a straight tangential line. To offset this force, the robot must exert an opposing torque at the joint of rotation.
