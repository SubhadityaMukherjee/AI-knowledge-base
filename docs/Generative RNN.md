# Generative RNN
- initial sequence is used as seed and output is sampled 
    - random or argmax to sample
    - normally not taking argmax but sample with respective [[Softmax]] probabilities -> allows to generate something different than input
- new output is used as seed to generate next 
- repeat until termination criterion
