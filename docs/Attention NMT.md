# [Attention](Attention.md) NMT
- [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
- [](https://aman.ai/papers/#neural-machine-translation-by-jointly-learning-to-align-and-translate) proposed an [Attention](Attention.md) mechanism to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation
- a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time
- [BLEU](BLEU.md)
