# Action Potential
- Sometimes called a “spike” or described as a neuron “firing,” an action potential occurs when there is a significant increase in the electrical activity along the membrane of a nerve cell. It is associated with neurons passing electrochemical messages down the [[Axon|axon]], releasing neurotransmitters to neighboring cells in the synapse.
