# No Bias Decay
- No [Learning_Rate_Decay_tricks](Learning_Rate_Decay_tricks.md)
- Equivalent to [Lp_Regularization](Lp_Regularization.md) L2 to all parameters to drive the values towards 0
- Only apply [Regularization](Regularization.md) to the weights
- Leave [Batch_Normalization](Batch_Normalization.md) [Layers](Layers.md) alone
- [LARS](LARS)
