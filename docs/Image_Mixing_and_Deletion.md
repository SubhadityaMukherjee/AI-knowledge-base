# Image Mixing and Deletion
- Cutout and CutMix argues that hindering image regions enforces the classifier to learn from the partially visible objects and understand the overall structure
- CutMix verifies this argument by showing enhanced focus towards the target class in
- Opposite to this, MixUp has shown to improve classifier's calibration and reduced prediction uncertainity
- mean of predictions vs accuracy where the confidence distribution for MixUp trained model is evenly distributed against the standard model whose disovertribution is towards higher conficence i.e. confidence
- Similarly, the loss contours obtained for a network trained with MixUp are smooth as compared to sharp contours in standarad training
- better generalization and robustness of MixUp against adversarial attacks.
