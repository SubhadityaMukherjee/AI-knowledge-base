# Counterfactual Fairness
- A fairness metric that checks whether a classifier produces the same result for one individual as it does for another individual who is identical to the first, except with respect to one or more sensitive attributes. Evaluating a classifier for counterfactual fairness is one method for surfacing potential sources of bias in a model.
- See ["When Worlds Collide Integrating Different Counterfactual Assumptions in Fairness"](https//papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/1271a7029c9df08643b631b02cf9e116-Paper.pdf) for a more detailed discussion of counterfactual fairness.
