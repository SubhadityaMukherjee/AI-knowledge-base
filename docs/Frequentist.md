- Measure probablity -> Counting
- Repeat an experiment n times and get the estimate : $\hat P$  (estimate based on finite amount of data)
- [[Law of large numbers]]
- Random variable X which takes values in a sample space S. 
- Measurement process hard to carry out in reality
- What does unbiased means? Especially because most things related to future input that we do not have yet
- Distibution of data points
- [[MLE]]
