# Heirarchial Refinement
- Split n dim volume -> finite set of discrete regions
- n dim hypercubes
- Construct regions where there is a higher point [[Density|density]]
- Fine grained info encoded -> smaller hypercubes to increase resolution
- n = 2 : quadtree
- n = 3 : octree
- ![[assets/Pasted image 20220316000739.png|im]]
