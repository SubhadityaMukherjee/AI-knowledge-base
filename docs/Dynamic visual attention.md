# Dynamic Visual Attention
- Incremental coding length (ICL) using the features of local image patches is proposed to maximise the entropy of the sampled visual features
- unexpected features elicit entropy gain in the perception state and are therefore assigned high energy
- The probability function of feature activities of this model is updated dynamically
