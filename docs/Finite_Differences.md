# Finite Differences
- $$f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx} \rightarrow \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}$$
- ![im](images/Pasted%20image%2020220411131651.png)
- Forward differences $$f'(x) = \frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i})}{\Delta x}$$
- Non Isotropic
- Backward differences $$f'(x) = \frac{f(x_{i})-f(x_{i-1})}{\Delta x}$$
- Non Isotropic
- Central differences $$f'(x) = \frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i-1})}{2\Delta x}$$
- [High_pass_filter](High_pass_filter.md)
- Non isotropic
