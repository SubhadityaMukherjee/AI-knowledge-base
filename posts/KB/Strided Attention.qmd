# [Strided](Strided.qmd) [Attention](Attention.qmd)
- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509v1)
- Sparse factorizations of the [attention](Attention.qmd) matrix
- Reduce to $O(n\sqrt{n})$
- Recompute [attention](Attention.qmd) matrices to save memory
- Fast [attention](Attention.qmd) kernels
- Works nicely for images, music etc with a periodic structure
- Otherwise with the [strided](Strided.qmd) pattern , the spatial coordinates do not correlate with the positions the elements might be more relevant in the future
