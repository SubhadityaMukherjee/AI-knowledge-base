## PhD Vs no PhD
- Arguments supporting PhD include:
	- You’ll have time to immerse yourself in research.
	- If you want to become a professor, you have to do a PhD.
	- Many top research labs such as DeepMind only interview PhD candidates.
	- You won’t be too poor as AI internships pay well.

- Arguments supporting no-PhD include:
	- There should be more people joining industry to bring research into production.
	- By the time you finish your PhD, what you learn might no longer be relevant.
	- Many professors have side gigs in the industry anyway so you can still work with them.
	- You won’t be poor for the next five years.

- Pursuing your passion, it turns out, is not legal in the US when you’re an international student.
