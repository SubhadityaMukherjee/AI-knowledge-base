# Cut, Paste and Learn
- generates new data by extracting object instances and pasting them on randomly selected background images.
- Instances are blended with various blending approaches, for example, gaussian blurring and poison blending, to reduce pixel artifacts around the augmented object boundaries.
- Added instances are also rotated, oc- cluded, and truncated to make the learning algo- rithm robust.
