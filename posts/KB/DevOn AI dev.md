# DevOn AI Dev



As the days go by, Machine Learning and AI are slowly becoming terms that every company wants to have in their portfolio. While this drive leads to many innovations, most companies are not sure how to do AI "well". They want to use AI but need clarification on whether it is required, how to handle bias, how to create proper data, or even what models (ML vs. DL) to choose. The job of an AI dev, then, is to provide the key information required to find and fulfill KPIs given any project. 

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. That being the case, I can step aside from my experience with AI and decide if a project needs another solution in reality. I am familiar with PyTorch, Tensorflow, supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and many of the other tools that are required to create successful AI applications. I am familiar with the pipeline, from analyzing data to building the model to deployment.

The customer is king, they say, and the first step in having happy clients is understanding what they truly want and then being able to give them a solution they can use. Although I have a lot to learn, I can contribute to any team I get the chance to work with. This job would be the perfect next step for me, and so I hope you give me a chance to work with you and your team.
