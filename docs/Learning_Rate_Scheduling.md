# Learning Rate [Scheduling](Scheduling.md)
- [Learning_Rate_Decay_tricks](Learning_Rate_Decay_tricks.md)
- [Gradient_Descent_gradients](Gradient_Descent_gradients.md)
- Increasing the batch size, reduces noise in the #gradients so a larger learning rate is okay
- [Linear_Learning_Rate_Scaling](Linear_Learning_Rate_Scaling.md)
- [Learning_Rate_Warmup](Learning_Rate_Warmup.md)
