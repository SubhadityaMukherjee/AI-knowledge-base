# Self Supervised Vision Transformers
- [An Empirical Study of Training Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02057)
	- recipes for [[Vision Transformer]] are yet to be built
	- [[Self supervised]]
	- instability is a major issue that degrades accuracy, and it can be hidden by apparently good results
	- improved when training is made more stable
	- [[MoCO]] v3, a framework which offers an incremental improvement of [[MoCO]]
