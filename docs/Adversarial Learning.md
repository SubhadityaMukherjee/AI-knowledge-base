# Adversarial Learning
- Consider data in a [[Manifold]]. The [[PDF]] is concentrated along a low dim [[Manifold]] $\mathcal{M}$
- Now the original picture is a point on the [[Manifold]] (dim = output layer size)
- Add noise to the image such that the image now appears to be in a direction orthogonal to $\mathcal{M}$ -> value of [[PDF]] shrinks dramatically
- Then the network has never seen this before and will return a random classification
