# Cognitive Foreperiod
```toc
```
- Time before stimulus
- Prepare to act

## Constant FP
- No uncertainty
- Up to ~150ms : RT decrease, then increase
- People prepare if warning - faster
- if longer intervals
	- avg response time increases
	- Temporal estimates get noiser : Temporal Uncertainty
		- not really prepared
		
- Faster if less time to prepare

## Variable FP
- Faster if more time to prepare
- Asymptotic decrease : plateau
- Try your best based on exp to be prepared
	- But stay prepared if you already are
- "Strategic" : aim to be prepared as late
	- Why? Dunno. Maybe energy conservation

### Distribution Effects
- Uniform
- Exponential
	- Many shorts
- Anti Exponential
	- Many long
- Prep strategy altered based on which type of distribution

### Sequential Effects
- Prep dependent on previous trials
	- If prev short, present longer : RTs are slow
- Traces of gradually forgetting previous trials
	- in the shape of prep effects
- Cannot just be accounted for by n-1 trials

## Transfer Effects
- Start with uniform - then something else - then uniform again
- Long lasting effects
- Even if participants were informed that things changed
- Even a week later

## Motivation Determined by
- Time
- Memory
- Motivation - still works on earlier prep?
