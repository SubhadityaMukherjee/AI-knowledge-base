# SamplePairing
- one epoch on ImageNet and 100 epochs on other datasets are completed without SamplePairing before mixed image data is added to the training
- Once the SamplePairing images are added to the training set, they run in cycles between 8:2 epochs, 8 with SamplePairing images, 2 without.
