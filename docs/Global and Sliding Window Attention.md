# Global and [[Sliding Window Attention]]
- [[Sliding Window Attention]] and [[Dilated Sliding Window Attention]] are not always enough
- global [[Attention|attention]]” on few pre-selected input locations.
- This [[Attention|attention]] is operation symmetric: that is, a token with a global [[Attention|attention]] attends to all tokens across the sequence, and all tokens in the sequence attend to it
