# Inverse Square Law
- for [force](Force.qmd) on a charge in an electric field of another charge: [Force](Force.qmd) is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
- $$F_{E}= \frac{\frac{1}{4pe_{0}}Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}$$
- [force](Force.qmd) on a mass in a gravitational field of another mass: [Force](Force.qmd) is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
- $$F_{G}= -G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}$$
