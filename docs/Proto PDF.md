# Proto [[PDF]]
- Generalized [[PDF]]
- Proto [[PDF]] $g_{0}$
- Any non negative function $g_{0}: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that has a finite integral $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}g_{0}(x)dx$$
- If we divide $g_{0}$ by its integral -> we get a normal [[PDF]] g

>   - Now if we can take a [[Proto PDF]] $g_{0} \geq f$ where we can sample from the [[PDF]] g
