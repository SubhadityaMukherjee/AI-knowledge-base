# Large Batch Training
- Generally slows down training
- If convex, convergence rate decreases with increase in batch size
- [Learning Rate Scheduling](Learning%20Rate%20Scheduling.md)
- Modified [Batch Normalization](Batch%20Normalization.md) with $\gamma=0$ for all BNs at the end of a residual block that micmics networks with less [Layers](Layers.md) and is easier to train at the start
- [No bias decay](No%20bias%20decay.md)
