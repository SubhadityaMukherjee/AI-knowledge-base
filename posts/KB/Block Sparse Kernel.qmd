# Block Sparse Kernel
- For networks with block sparse weights
- Can choose amount of [sparsity](sparsity.qmd)
- Can replace normal [Dense](Dense.qmd) [Layers](Layers.qmd) with sparse and wide or sparse and deep
- ![im](images/Pasted%20image%2020220425233755.png)
- Enables wider and deeper networks
- Only compute on non zero blocks

- Connectivity is unaffected in the spatial dimensions
- Compute cost is only prop to number of non zero weights
- [Small World graphs](Small%20World%20graphs.qmd)
- Also useful for compression
