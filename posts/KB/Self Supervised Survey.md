# Self Supervised Survey


## Abstract
- Large-scale labeled data are generally required to train deep neural networks in order to obtain better performance in visual feature learning from images or videos for computer vision applications 
- as a subset of unsupervised learning methods, self-supervised learning methods are proposed to learn general image and video features from large-scale unlabeled data without using any human-annotated labels 

## Motivation
- The performance of deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) greatly depends on their capability and the amount of training data. 
- collection and annotation of large-scale datasets are time-consuming and expensive 
- Compared to image datasets, collection and annotation of video datasets are more expensive due to the temporal dimension 
- To avoid time-consuming and expensive data annotations, many self-supervised methods were proposed to learn visual features from large-scale unlabeled images or videos without using any human annotations 
- During the self-supervised training phase, a predefined pretext task is designed for ConvNets to solve, and the pseudo labels for the pretext task are automatically generated based on some attributes of data 
- Then the ConvNet is trained to learn object functions of the pretext task 
- After the self-supervised training finished, the learned visual features can be further transferred to downstream tasks (especially when only relatively small data available) as pretrained models to improve performance and overcome over- fitting. 
- shallow layers capture general low-level features like edges, corners, and textures while deeper layers capture task related high-level features
