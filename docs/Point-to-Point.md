# Point-to-Point
- [[Manipulator]] motion in which a limited number of points along a projected path of motion is specified. The [[Manipulator|manipulator]] moves from point to point rather than a continuous smooth path.

>   - Also known as [[Point-to-Point]] Motion, Joint Motion Type is a method of path interpolation that commands the movement of the robot by moving each joint directly to the commanded position so that all axis arrive to the position at the same time. Although the path is predictable, it will not be linear.

> - [Pick and Place Cycle](Pick and Place Cycle.md)
>   - The amount of time it takes for a [[Manipulator|manipulator]] to pick up an object and place it in a desired location, then return to its rest position. This includes time during the acceleration and deceleration phases of a particular task. The robot movement is controlled from one point location in space to another in a [[Point-to-Point]] (PTP) motion system. Each point is programmed into the robot's control memory and then played back during the work cycle.
