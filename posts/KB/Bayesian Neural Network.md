# [Bayesian](Bayesian.md.md) Neural Network
- [Bayesian Model Estimation](Bayesian%20Model%20Estimation.md.md)
- Generally we want to learn Joint [Probability](Probability.md.md) distribution $P(y|x)$ but this does not use the model parameters w
- We need $$P(w|D) = \frac{P(D|w)P(w)}{P(D)}$$
	- D is the labelled dataset
	- Model is now defined by structure and parameters
- The parameters encode information about [Uncertainty](Uncertainty.md.md)
	- Can be understood using [Bayesian Predictive Posterior](Bayesian%20Predictive%20Posterior.md.md)
