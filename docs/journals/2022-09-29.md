- Unfortunately, the program we used to create the second experiment, IBEX farms, has shutdown. So it's currently not possible to do the experiment yourself.
- For lmer output what you need to report are the Estimate (β) , Standard Error (SE), and p-value. You can also add the t-value. So somethin like:  'The model showed a significant difference between X and Y **(****β = -1.58, _SE_ = 0.36, _t_= 4.3, _p_** **< 0.001)'**. 
- Sometimes, depending on the journal where you are publishing your paper, you may be asked to include the Confidence Interval (CI), especially when you present the results on a Table. In case you are curious and want to check the confidence interval, you can run this: _lsmeans(your model, "Fixed factor (e.g.Ambiguity)")._
