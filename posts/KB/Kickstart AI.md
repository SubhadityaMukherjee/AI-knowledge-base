# Kickstart AI

It is not every day that you find an AI company that not only wants to make a real-world impact but also cares about responsible AI. I found out about Kickstart.AI and the hackathons from some classmates (who are from my course at the RUG) who interned with you recently. Their project was on "Using Data to Predict Food Insecurity." (Shray Juneja,Chaoyi Wang, and Lonneke Pulles study AI at the RUG as well.) Looking at the projects that Kickstart is involved in, it is obvious just how much talent and hard work is behind each of them. I really want to take on the challenge and contribute to making some awesome ideas a reality while being mindful of the societal impact and explainability of each of the models used.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. I love hackathons, and truly think that they bring out the best in every member of a team. That being said, what I love the most is building prototypes of ideas. Be it an AI-powered credit scoring model, a model that converts between materials (e.g., glass to wood), or applications powered by LLMs. Any idea is fair game. But I also care about how any of the solutions that I am part of affect the end users. My master thesis was on XAI, and I firmly believe that an AI model needs a detailed understanding of biases before production, another aspect that I am familiar with.

I have a lot to learn, but as an AI developer, we are always students. It is not every day you find a position that you enjoy and also think you can contribute something to, and I sincerely hope you give me a chance!
