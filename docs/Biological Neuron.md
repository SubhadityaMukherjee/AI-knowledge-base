# Biological Neuron

- ([from](https://publish.obsidian.md/fabian-groeger/Machine+Learning+%26+Deep+Learning/Deep+Learning/Architectures/ANN/Biological+Neuron))
- composed of 
    - cell body
    - [dendrites](Dendrites.md): many branching extensions
    - [axon](Axon.md): very long extension that splits off at its tip into many branches called synaptic terminals
- composed in a network (e.g. brain) by synaptic terminals of one neuron connected to [dendrites](Dendrites.md) of other neurons
- electrical impulses (signals) are sent from other neurons via these synapses
- if a neuron receives a sufficient number of signal from other neurons within a few milliseconds, it is exited and fires its own signals (activation)
- connectivity in a biological neural system is huge, human brain:
    - number of neurons: $\approx 10^{11}$
    - number of connections per neuron: $\approx 10^4$
- networks are organized into hierarchical structures
