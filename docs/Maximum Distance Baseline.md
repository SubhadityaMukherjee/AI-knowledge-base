# Maximum Distance Baseline
```toc
```

- This baseline is called the Maximum Distance baseline and creates a baseline by constructing an image with the largest value of the L1 distance from the original image
- The problem with the maximum distance is that it doesn’t represent the “absence of feature”. It contains the information about the original image, just in a different form.
