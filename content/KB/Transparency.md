# Transparency


- a model is considered to be transparent if by itself it is understandable. Since a model can feature different degrees of understandability, transparent models in Section 3 are divided into three tags: simulatable models, decomposable models and algorithmically transparent models
- understandability is a two-sided matter: model understandability and human understandability in @gunningExplainableArtificialIntelligence
