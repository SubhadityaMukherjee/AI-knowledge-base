# Concurrency
- The number of tasks that can be executed in parallel is the degree of concurrency of a decomposition.
- always equal to the number of leaves in the tree
- Both the maximum and the average degrees of concurrency usually increase as the [[Parallel Granularity]] of tasks becomes smaller (finer)
- $$CriticalPath = \frac{\text{Total amount of work}}{\text{Critical path length}}$$
