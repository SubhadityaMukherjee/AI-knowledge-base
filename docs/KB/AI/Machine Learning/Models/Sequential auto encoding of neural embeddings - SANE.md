# Sequential auto encoding of neural embeddings - SANE
```toc
```
- learn compressed latent representation of model sequence
- [[Contrastive Loss|contrastive loss]]
- capacity scales with model size
- gracefully scale to larger models with different architectures
- different models share embedding space
- unified for generative and discriminative
