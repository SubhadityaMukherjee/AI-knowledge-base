# Self Organizing Maps
- Kohonen maps
- Crumbled up grid of SOM neurons
- #neuromorphic
- Essentially : need to map a high dim space to a grid of neurons while trying to preserve the neighborhood relations from the high dim space. This is technically impossible so compromise.
- First initialized with small random values
- For each new pattern, identify [[Best Maching Unit]] based on current vectors. Reduce the value of r. And pull the point to the part of the grid with similar weight vectors.
	- Update weights $$w(v_{kl}) \leftarrow w(v_{kl}) + \lambda f_r(d(v_{kl}, v_{BMU}))(x-w(v_{kl}))$$
	- $\lambda$ is learning rate
	- d is Euclidean Distance between two neurons in grid.
	- $f_{r}(0)=1$. Tends to 0 as argument grows. r is radius. Greater values, will spread it out.
	- Regulated by $f_r(d(v_{kl}, v_{BMU}))$ 
- Eventually this will lead to an organization. Covered evenly after a while. Eventually neighbors of $v_0$ would have weights towards $w(v_0)$ . And $w(v_{0)} \approx mean(all patterns x)$
- Repeat until response stops. Each members BMU rate is too low to expand.
- Start with large r and then slow down.
