# Non Relational Inductive Bias
- [ActivationFunctions](ActivationFunctions.md)
	- allow the model to capture the non-linearity hidden in the data
- [Dropout](Dropout.md)
	- helps the network avoid memorizing the data by forcing random subsets of the network to each learn the data pattern. As a result, the obtained model, in the end, is able to generalize better
- [Weight Decay](Weight%20Decay)
	- puts constraints on the modelâ€™s weights
- [Batch Normalization](Batch%20Normalization.md) , [Layer Normalization](Layer%20Normalization.md) , [[Instance Normalization]]
	- Reduces [[Covariate Shift]]
- [Augmentation](Augmentation.md)
- [Optimizers](Optimizers.md)
