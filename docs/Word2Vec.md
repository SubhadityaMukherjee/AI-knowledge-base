# Word2Vec
- [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)
- Duality of vector representations of words derived by various models on a collection of syntactic and semantic language tasks involving word similarity
- possible to train high quality [[Word Vectors|word vectors]] using very simple model architectures

>   - [[Word2Vec]] relies only on local information of language. That is, the semantics learnt for a given word, is only affected by the surrounding words.
