# [[Bayesian]] Neural Network
- [[Bayesian Model Estimation]]
- Generally we want to learn Joint [[Probability]] distribution $P(y|x)$ but this does not use the model parameters w
- We need $$P(w|D) = \frac{P(D|w)P(w)}{P(D)}$$
	- D is the labelled dataset
	- Model is now defined by structure and parameters
- The parameters encode information about [[Uncertainty]]
	- Can be understood using [[Bayesian Predictive Posterior]]
