- [Vanishingexploding gradients](Vanishingexploding%20gradients.qmd) , in [Backprop](Backprop.qmd), they break down when sequences are long.
- Distance between the relevant words are too long
- Followed up [LSTM)](Long Short Term Memory (LSTM|Long Short Term Memory (LSTM|[LSTM)](LSTM)](LSTM)](Long Short Term Memory (LSTM|Long Short Term Memory (LSTM|[LSTM)](LSTM).qmd).qmd)
