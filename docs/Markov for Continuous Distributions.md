# Markov for Continuous Distributions
- Family of [[PDF]] 
- If a [[markov chain]] with state set S, matrix M is executed m times . The transition probabilities transmit between states and then, $$P(X_{n+m}=s_{j}|X_{n}= s_{i}) = M^{m}(i, j)$$
- where $M^{m}= M \cdot M \cdot M â€¦ \cdot M$ (m times)
- To get the [[pdf]] $$g^{n+1}(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}T(x|y)g^{n}(y)dy$$
- [[Invariant Distribution]]
