# Rescorla-Wagner Algorithm
- Rescorla & Wagner (1972): animals and humans also learn associations by paying [attention](Attention.md) to what is not associated.
- $$\Delta V = \alpha \beta_{1}\beta_{2}(\lambda = \Sigma V)$$
- ▶ V = association strength ▶ ∆ V : Change in association strength ▶ λ = maximum values of the unconditional stimulus ▶ Set to 1: when US is present (food) ▶ Set to 0: when not present ▶ α = learning rate ▶ β = varies the effects of negative or positive evidence ▶ ΣV = sum of associated strengths for all cues/[features](Features.md)/conditions stimuli
- negative instances are also useful to learning
- Logical Problem of Lang Acquisition
- Children don't get negative evidence = must be innate
- [Cross-situational learning](Cross-situational%20learning.md)
- [Propose-but-verify](Propose-but-verify.md)
- [Rescorla-Wagner Blocking](Rescorla-Wagner%20Blocking.md)
- Rescorla-Wagner = error-driven
- After a strong association is made, as long as it is confirmed by data, no new learning will occur
- The model only learns when the predicted outcome differs from actual outcome
