# Visual Implicit Learning
- Does ability to learn implicit dependencies correlate with ability to correctly predict the next word in speech?
- Participants saw a sequence of colors light up on screen
- They then had to reproduce it by clicking on the same sequence
- Auditory Only Sentence [Perception](Perception.md)
- 25 highly predictable and 25 zero-predictability sentences
- acoustically degraded by processing them with a sinewave vocoder to 6 channels
- Ability to pick up/learn statistical dependencies seems almost to be a new cognitive function
- Shows a potential connection between sequence learning and language modelling ability
- Learning simple dependencies is not so difficult it seems. But natural language has many dependencies at a distance
