# Pruning
- Mainly that of being able to reduce the size, cost and computational requirements of my models, all while maintaning the accuracy (sort of atleast).
- Generally this comes about by removing parameters in some form or fashion.
- Rather than taking a mask, we can prune certain parts of the network by setting them to 0 or by dropping them if required. (aka weights and biases)
- In most cases, the network is first trained for a while. Then pruned. Which reduces its accuracy and is thus trained again (fine tuning). This cycle is repeated until we get the results we require.
- Major Types of Pruning Methods
- [Structure Based Pruning](Structure%20Based%20Pruning.md)
- [Scoring Pruning Approaches](Scoring%20Pruning%20Approaches.md)
- [Scheduling](Scheduling.md)
- [Fine Tuning Based Pruning](Fine%20Tuning%20Based%20Pruning.md)
- [Global Magnitude Based Pruning](Global%20Magnitude%20Based%20Pruning.md)
- [Global Gradient Magnitude Based Pruning](Global%20Gradient%20Magnitude%20Based%20Pruning.md)
- [Layerwise Gradient Magnitude Based Pruning](Layerwise%20Gradient%20Magnitude%20Based%20Pruning.md)
- [Random Pruning](Random%20Pruning.md)
- [Layerwise Magnitude Based Pruning](Layerwise%20Magnitude%20Based%20Pruning.md)
