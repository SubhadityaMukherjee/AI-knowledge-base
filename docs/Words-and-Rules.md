# Words-and-Rules
- Look up past-tense
		- No past-tense stored? Generate form
	- Why symbolic? It uses the abstract '[verb](Verb.md)'
	- Rules that refer to these categories are used to guide processing
	- [[past tense]]
	- Irregular forms stored in associative memory (declarative memory)
	- Symbolic rules produce [past tense](past%20tense.md) forms (procedural memory)
	- look-up is quicker than rule application
	- rule application takes more time but is always done 'on-the-fly'
	- Time 1: Every form is memorized (irregular and regular)
	- Time 2: child notices pattern: [verb](Verb.md) root+ed = past
	- Child creates a rule
	- Child applies rule to all forms: overgeneralization
	- Time 3: Child realizes that there are irregular and regular forms
		- creates a dual system: irregular forms are retrieved from memory, regular forms are created by a rule
		- new and novel verbs will get regular endings in [past tense](past%20tense.md) unless exposed to irregular past
		- the fact that children seem to learn a rule = language must be symbolic
	- Traditional U-shaped learning predicts children won't be able to create past-tense forms for novel verbs when they are in the initial stage. This isn't consistent with data
	- Overregularization is not common
	- Cannot account for the presence of two past forms
		- e.g. dream/dreamed-dreamt, light/lit-lighted
	- In production experiments
		- Irregulars produced faster
		- Frequent irregulars are produced faster than infrequent irregulars (Prasada et al., 1990; Albright & Hayes 2003)
		- No difference between frequent and infrequent regulars
	- Maybe because experiments always present the root form? (1) This is a girl who knows how to dance. She did the same
		- Root presentation might mask differences due to frequency in regulars
