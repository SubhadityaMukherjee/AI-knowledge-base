# [[Probability.md]] [[Density.md]] Function
- If X is a random variable(RV) that takes values in $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$. PDF is a fn $f:S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\geq0}$ that satisfies:
	- For every subvolume $A \subseteq S$ of S, the prob $P(X \in A)$ that X gives a value in A is $$P(X\in A) = \int_Af(x)dx$$
- Function which maps from a random process to a quantified version
    - eg. 1 when heads and 0 when tails
