# Instruction Pipelining
- used in the design of modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs to increase their [[Instruction Throughput]] for the entire workload
- divide the processing of a CPU instruction into a series of independent steps o microinstructions with storage at the end of each step.
- This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step
- IF: Instruction Fetch
- ID: Instruction Decode, register fetch
- EX: Execution
- MEM: Memory Access
- WB: Register write Back
