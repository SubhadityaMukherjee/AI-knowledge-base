# Adaptive Input Representation
- [Adaptive Input Representations for Neural Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10853)
- varying the size of input word embeddings for neural language modeling
- improve accuracy while drastically reducing the number of model parameters
- more than twice as fast to train than the popular character input CNN while having a lower number of parameters
