# YOLO
- [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
- [LinearRegression](LinearRegression.md) problem
- predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation
- loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance and the entire model is trained jointly
- [Picasso Dataset](Picasso%20Dataset.md), [People Art Dataset](People%20Art%20Dataset.md)
