- combines two scalable tools: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons; (2) neuron-influenced aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. An attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes is created. Summit combines famous methods such as computing synthetic prototypes of features and showing examples from the dataset that maximize special neurons of different layers. Deeper in the graph, it is examined how the low-level features combine to create high-level features. Novel as well is that it exploits neural networks with activation atlases [63]
- This method uses feature inversion to visualize millions of activations from an image classification network to create an explorable activation atlas of features the network has learned. Their approach is able to reveal visual abstractions within a model and even high-level misunderstandings in a model that can be exploited. Activation atlases are a novel way to peer into convolutional vision networks and represents a global, hierarchical, and human-interpretable overview of concepts within the hidden layers.
