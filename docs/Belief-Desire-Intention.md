```

- To judge the ethics of an agent's own actions, the awareness process generates the beliefs that describe the current situation facing the agent and the goals of the agent.
- Based on the beliefs and goals, the evaluation process generates the set of possible actions and desirable actions
- goodness process then computes the set of ethical actions based on the agent's beliefs, desires, actions, and moral value rules
- rightness process evaluates whether or not executing a possible action is right under the current situation and selects an action which satisfies the rightfulness requirement
