# Memory Trace
- the researchers were able to identify specific neurons in the brain’s motor cortex — an area responsible for controlling movements — that were activated during the learning process.
- The researchers tagged these potential engram cells with a fluorescent marker so they could see if they also played a role in recalling the memory later on

>   - participants learn the timing of S2 by storing a [[memory trace]] on each trial, which contains a temporal profile of the events on that trial.
>   - unique [[memory trace]] is created on each trial, which contains the temporal profile of inhibition (during the foreperiod) and activation (after S2 occurrence) experienced on that trial, along with representations of S1, S2, and the response to S2
>   - each new [[memory trace]] is added to an accumulating pool of memory traces created on earlier trials

>   - A correct but slower-than-expected response signals that the [[memory trace]] has decayed further than assumed, meaning that the item’s true rate of forgetting is higher than the current estimate.
>   - item’s [[memory trace]] actually dropped below the retrieval threshold, which means that the true rate of forgetting should be higher because this item’s activation was expected to be above the threshold (which was fixed at [[ACT-R]]’s default value).
>   - An unexpectedly fast correct response, on the other hand, indicates a stronger- than-expected [[memory trace]] and implies that the estimated rate of forgetting should be adjusted downward.

>   - These findings support a model in which the representation of a time interval is not a single [[memory trace]], but a pool of experiences in which recency and match to the current request determine the impact of single experiences.
>   - The main specific choice we made in this model was to treat every experience with each of the intervals as a separate [[memory trace]]

>   - Based on the current assumptions of MTP, the preparation at any foreperiod is determined by the activationinhibition states (strengths of activation and inhibition) stored in each [[memory trace]], the strength of each [[memory trace]] ([[memory trace]] is more dispersed and weaker as the foreperiod gets longer), and the total number of previous memory traces with each foreperiod
