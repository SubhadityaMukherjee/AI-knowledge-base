# Structure Based [[Pruning]]
- Regarding structural choices, some authors choose to prune individual parameters which produces a sparse network (lots of 0s). This might not be very ideal for storing efficiently. 
- Some others consider methods where they group certain parameters and remove them as groups. This is more optimized.
