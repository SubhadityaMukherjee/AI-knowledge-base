# Kinesthetic Teaching
- H. Kasaei et al., “Interactive open-ended object, affordance and grasp learning for robotic manipulation.” ICRA 2019.
- Formulate object grasping as a supervised learning problem,  
- An appropriate grasp configuration can be learned from human demonstrations
- Primary assumption -> familiar objects can be grasped in a similar way.
