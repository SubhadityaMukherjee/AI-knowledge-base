**OpenML**

According to the knowledge note [[KB/OpenML <> scikit-learn hackathon]], it seems that there's a connection between OpenML and scikit-learn, but the specific details are unclear. The note mentions trying to load parquet files from OpenML in fetch_openml, which might be related to an issue or feature request.

If you're looking for more information on OpenML, I'd suggest checking out other relevant notes, such as:

* [[KB/DeepLearning]]: This note has a section on "Features" that might be related to OpenML.
* [[KB/OpenML <> scikit-learn hackathon]]: As mentioned earlier, this note seems to have some connection with scikit-learn and OpenML.

Please let me know if you'd like me to expand on this or provide more context!

**Swish**

I couldn't find any specific information related to "Swish" in your existing knowledge. However, I can try to help you with a general query.

If you're looking for something related to "Swish", could you please provide more context or details? This might help me narrow down the search and provide a more accurate response.

That being said, there is one note that caught my attention: [[KB/VTAB]]. While it's not directly related to "Swish", VTAB (Visual Transformers for Vessel Segmentation) might be of interest if you're working with image-related tasks or computer vision. Please let me know if this is something you'd like me to expand on!
