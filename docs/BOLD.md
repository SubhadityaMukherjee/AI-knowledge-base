# BOLD
- Blood oxygenation level dependant signal
	- Indirect measure of neural activity
	- Blood goes to a place
- When neurons fire or increase their firing rate, they draw on oxygen and various nutrients.
- The circulatory system of the brain reacts by sending the region that just fired more highly-oxygenated blood than is needed. This results in an increased blood oxygen level in the activated region.
- With right pulse sequence, an [MRI](MRI.md) scanner is able to detect this difference in blood oxygen level
- Factors such as drugs, substances [](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/BOLD_response#cite_note-3) and excitation [](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/BOLD_response#cite_note-4) have been shown to increase BOLD response. Conversely, age and brain pathology [](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/BOLD_response#cite_note-5) have been shown to decrease BOLD response
