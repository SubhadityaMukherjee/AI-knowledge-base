- This study investigated three techniques designed to increase the chances that second language (L2) readers look up and learn unfamiliar words during and after reading an L2 text
- They could look up the meaning of unfamiliar words in an online dictionary
- Test announcement and word relevance substantially prompted participants to use the online dictionary more.
- Only test announcement and vocabulary task (not word relevance) affected performance in the word recognition test positively
- oth word relevance and postreading vocabulary task substantially affected word retention in the [[recall]] posttests
- low incidence of vocabulary acquisition through reading ("input only") can be substantially boosted by techniques that make students look up the meaning of unknown words, process their form-meaning relationship elaborately, and process them again after reading ("input plus").
