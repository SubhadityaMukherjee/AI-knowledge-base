# Exponential Distribution
- How long you have to wait for something after the it has happened once already
- Average rate /unit reference time
- [[PDF]] $$p(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$ and $x \geq 0$
- Expectation $$E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}$$
- ![[assets/Pasted image 20220319141230.png|im]]
- Rate : $$\hat \lambda = \frac{1}{N-1}\Sigma_{i = 1, â€¦, N}t_{i+1}-t_{i}$$
- [[Spiking Networks]]
