# Semantic Analysis
- Meaning of the language
- Meanings of the word to extend and perhaps disambiguate the result returned by the syntactic parse
- Look up the individual words in a dictionary (or [[Lexicon]]) and extract their meanings
- But many words have several meanings
	- [[Lexical Disambiguation]]
- [[Sentence level processing]]
