# Robotic Joints
- Joints connect the [manipulator](Manipulator.md) links
- A joint normally provides one Controllable Degree of Freedom (CDOF)
- For each CDOF one separate [actuator](Actuator.md) is needed
- An endeffector with many (C)DOFs needs a lot of actuators!
- [Rotary Joint](Rotary%20Joint.md) , [Prismatic Joint](Prismatic%20Joint.md)
