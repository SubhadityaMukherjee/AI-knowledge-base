# Relevance Account


- (Philip 2011)
- pragmatic extension of the theory of Drozd and Loosbroek (2006)
- Philip claims that the problem that children have to solve when assigning a domain to a universal quantifier is which objects in the context should be taken as relevant.
- Adults rely on their world knowledge in identifying the presupposed set
- As formulated in the Normal World Constraint, "if an object is contextually relevant, then there is a normal situation that it is part of."
