# Gaming Addiction
- [fMRI](fMRI.md) was performed while showing game images to online game addicts.
- According to [Brain Areas](Brain%20Areas.md) control group, right orbitofrontal cortex, right nucleus accumbens, bilateral anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right caudate nucleus activation were observed.
- These areas are the rewarding areas
- The results show that the same addiction to substance can share the same neuro-biological mechanisms with the extreme gaming demands of online gaming addiction.
