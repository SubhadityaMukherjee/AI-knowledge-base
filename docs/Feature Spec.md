# Feature Spec
- Describes the information required to extract features data from the tf.Example protocol buffer. Because the tf.Example protocol buffer is just a container for data, you must specify the following
	- the data to extract (that is, the keys for the features)
	- the data type (for example, float or int)
	- The length (fixed or variable)
