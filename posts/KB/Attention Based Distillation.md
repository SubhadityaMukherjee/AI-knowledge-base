# [[Attention.md|Attention]] Based Distillation
- That is to say, knowledge about feature embedding is transferred using [[Attention.md|attention]] map functions. Unlike the [[Attention.md|attention]] maps, a different attentive knowledge distillation method was proposed by Song et al. (2018). An [[Attention.md|attention]] mechanism is used to assign different confidence rules (Song et al., 2018).
