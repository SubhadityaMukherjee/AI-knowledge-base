# Default Mode Network
- Brain is organized into coherent spatio-temporal networks such as this one
- [Brain areas](Brain%20Areas.md) in the [Brain Cortex](Brain%20Cortex.md) that constantly decreased their activity while performing highly demanding task
- Some studies revealed task-induced activations in the DMN, e.g. when internally directed/self-related cognition is required
- Altered with addictions
- [Functional connectivity](Functional%20Connectivity.md) within DMN may predict successful quitting, the intensity of withdrawal-induced craving and the degree of cognitive decline in addictions
- They [^1] found altered relationship between the [Dorsolateral Prefrontal cortex](Dorsolateral%20Prefrontal%20cortex) (as key node of the cognitive control network) and the [Anterior Cingulate](Anterior%20Cingulate)/[Prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex) (as key nodes of the DMN)
