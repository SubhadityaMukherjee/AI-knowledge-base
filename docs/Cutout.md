# Cutout
- @devriesImprovedRegularizationConvolutional2017
- removes constant size square patches randomly by replacing them with any constant value.
- The selection of region is performed by selecting a pixel value randomly and placing a square around it
- Cutout can be expressed as an element-wise multiplication operation $x_{cutout} = x \odot M$, where $x$ is the original image, $M$ is a binary mask of the same size as $x$ with randomly chosen coordinates of a square patch of pixels to be cut out, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

>   - Keep- Augment identifies the salient area in an image and assures the image generated by the augmenta- tion strategies, for example, [[Cutout]], [[RandAugment]] [14], [[CutMix]] [82] or [[AutoAugment]] [13], contains salient region in it.

>   - The algorithm tries to overcome drawbacks of [[Cutout]], [[Random Erasing]], and [[Hide and Seek]] that are prone to deleting important information entirely or leaving it untouched without making it harder for the algorithm to learn.

>   - [[Cutout]] and [[CutMix]] argues that hindering image regions enforces the classifier to learn from the partially visible objects and understand the overall structure
