# Manifold
- Data manifolds are an abstraction 
- Only geometric insights are important
- Locally around some point c where the [[pdf]] is large -> It will stay large only for a small fraction of directions
	- Those directions span a low dimensional hyperplane around c
	- "low dimensional sheets"
	- curved path
- In an n dimensional real vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$  . Embedding space
	- $m \leq n$ is a positive integer
	- An m dim manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is a subset of the vector space where one can smoothly map a neighborhood of that point to a neighborhood of the origin in m dim Euclidean space
		- Locally represents Euclidean space
- Only surface and not interior
- No sharp edges or spikes
- Can be exploited by [[Adversarial Learning]]
- Examples
	- 1 dim -> Lines in some high dim figure : B
	- 2 dim -> Surfaces : A
