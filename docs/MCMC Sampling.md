# MCMC [Sampling](Sampling)
- Complex distribution with only a proto [PDF](PDF.md) $g_{0}$ that is known
- [Markov Chain](Markov%20Chain.md)
- [Detailed Balance](Detailed%20Balance.md)
	- Sufficient but not necessary for [Markov Chain](Markov%20Chain.md) to be a [Sampler](Sampler.md) for g
- [Factors for MC estimate](Factors%20for%20MC%20estimate.md)
