## Scoring Pruning Approaches
- Like all networks, scoring becomes essential when we try to choose which parameter to get rid of. 
- Some authors suggest removing based on absolute values, others decide to prune based on the contributions of that parameter to the entire network. 
- Others remove based on a score given.

- Some perform pruning locally, while others perform it globally across the network.
