- **09: 55** Day 2 of the fastai course. lets see what today brings us.
- [ULMFit](../ULMFit.md)
- **11: 00** I think Ive had enough for now. The NLP bits still seem not very interesting to me, although I might look into it after a little while. I do want to focus on implementation now.
- Maybe I will read the fastai blog for interesting bits or just code. Probably code.
