# Pendant Teaching
- The mapping and recording of the position and orientation of a robot and/or manipulator system as the robot is manually moved in increments from an initial state along a path to a final goal state. The position and orientation of each critical point (joints, robot base, etc.) is recorded and stored in a database for each taught position the robot passes through on its path toward its final goal. The robot may now repeat the path on its own by following the path stored in the database.
