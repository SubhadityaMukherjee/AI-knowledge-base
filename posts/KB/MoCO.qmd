# MoCO
- [Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)
- unsupervised visual representation learning
- contrastive learning as dictionary look-up, MoCo builds a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder
- large and consistent dictionary on-the-fly
- [ImageNet](ImageNet.qmd)
- transfer well to downstream tasks.
- [PASCAL VOC](PASCAL%20VOC.qmd)
- [COCO](COCO.qmd)
- visual representation encoder by matching an encoded query
- to a dictionary of encoded keys using a [contrastive loss](Contrastive%20Loss.qmd)
- dictionary is built as a queue, with the current mini-batch enqueued
- oldest mini-batch dequeued
- slowly progressing encoder
- momentum update with the query encoder
