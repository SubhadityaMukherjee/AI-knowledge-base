# Informativeness
```toc
```

- ML models are used with the ultimate intention of supporting decision making
- should not be forgotten that the problem being solved by the model is not equal to that being faced by its human counterpart
- great deal of information is needed in order to be able to relate the user's decision to the solution given by the model, and to avoid falling in misconception pitfalls.
- explainable ML models should give information about the problem being tackled.
