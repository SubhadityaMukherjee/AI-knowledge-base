# Nucleus Sampling
- Nucleus (or top-p) Sampling, a simple but effective method that captures the region of confidence of language models effectively to draw the best out of neural generation
- By sampling text from the dynamic nucleus of the [probability](Probability.md) distribution, which allows for diversity while effectively truncating the less reliable tail of the distribution, the resulting text better demonstrates the quality of human text, yielding enhanced diversity without sacrificing fluency and coherence.
