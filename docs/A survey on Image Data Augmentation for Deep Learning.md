## Discussion
- It is easy to explain the benefit of horizontal [Flipping](Flipping.md) or random [[cropping]]
- However, it is not clear why mixing pixels or entire images together such as in PatchShuffle [[regularization]] or SamplePairing is so effective.
- dditionally, it is difficult to interpret the representations learned by neural networks for GAN-based augmentation, variational auto-encoders, and meta-learning.
- An interesting characteristic of these augmentation methods is their ability to be combined together.
- The GAN framework possesses an intrinsic property of recursion which is very interesting
- Samples taken from GANs can be augmented with traditional augmentations such as lighting filters, or even used in neural network augmentation strategies such as [[Smart Augmentation]] or [[Neural Augmentation]] to create even more samples. These samples can be fed into further GANs and dramatically increase the size of the original dataset.
- An interesting question for practical Data Augmentation is how to determine postaugmented dataset size.
- no consensus about the best strategy for combining data warping and oversampling techniques
- One important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the initial, limited dataset
- There are no existing augmentation techniques that can correct a dataset that has very poor diversity with respect to the testing data
