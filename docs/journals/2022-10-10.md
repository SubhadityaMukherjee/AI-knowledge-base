## Initial Presentation
- Eliminate interpretive confound -> locative scenes
	- locative pictures with animals and other entities shown in containers of various sorts (e.g., bananas in baskets, bears in beds)
	- systematically varied both the syntactic position of the universal quantifier and whether the subject of the sentence referred to the containers or the entities in them

### Participants
- Different from the exp 1
- Twelve 7-year-olds (M = 7;6, range = 7;1–7;10), twelve 8-year-olds (M = 8;6, range = 8;0–8;11), and twelve 9-year-olds (M = 9;5, range = 9;0–9;10)

### Materials
- Focus on locative
- 27 pairs of pictures depicting various entities arranged in containers (e.g., alligators in bathtubs, turtles in tanks, apples in bowls)
- The pictures showed distributive arrangements with the entities and containers in partial, one-to-one correspondence with each other.

### Analysis
- The main effect of quantifier and all of the interactions involving quantifiers were not significant.
- Across syntactic constructions, 7-year-olds preferred the picture with the extra animals or objects as opposed to the picture with the extra containers.
- n contrast, the majority of 9-year-olds correctly varied their picture selections in accordance with the varying syntactic constructions and performed above chance as a group for all sentence types.
- Experiment 2 replicated one of the main findings of Experiment 1: Only 9-yearolds as a group consistently identified the domain of the universal quantifier and selected the appropriate picture at above-chance levels for distributive events in which sets of objects were in partial, one-to-one correspondence.
- The observed bias to prefer locative scenes in which all of the containers were filled (the so-called garage-centered bias) has been observed many times; see Drozd (2001) for a review
- These results are difficult to reconcile with Kang's

## General Discussion
- Across all participants, no errors were made on filler sentences indicating that the participants were generally compliant with the task instructions
- Performance on the task was not at ceiling, with adults making errors on an average of 21% of the trials
- Our findings that both children and adults make errors in quantifier interpretation are more readily explained by the underspecification account of Sanford and Sturt (2002).
- The results demonstrate that many school-age children and adults had considerable difficulty in restricting the domain of a universal quantifier, especially when two sets of entities were in partial, one-to-one correspondence. This result contrasts most dramatically with the near perfect performance of preschool children in Crain et al. (1996)
- This suggests that the problem does not reside in the child's syntax, given the similarities in sentence structures used across studies, but in
- stead has to do with the difficulty of selecting the appropriate set of entities and avoiding distraction by salient objects.
- Taken together, the experiments suggest that it was the collective scenes as opposed to the use of all that improved children's performance in Experiment 1. Collective scenes were easier presumably because the group depiction aided the child in isolating one set of entities relative to the other
- We suspect that both children and adults make errors in comprehension because they engage in shallow processing that causes inaccurate mapping between syntactic and semantic representations.
- Shallow processing also provides a straightforward explanation of the errors made by adults in Experiment 3. Their high error rates suggest that adult listeners often do not tax their limited information-processing capacities by conducting exhaustive syntactic analyses of sentences but rather make use of simpler strategies in generating reasonable guesses

## Final Presentation

### Exp 2
- Objective : Eliminate interpretive confound for locative scenes
- Why : Kang(2001) -> better performance when universal quantifier modifies the subject
- How :
	- Entities shown in containers (Eg: Animals in bathtubs) (#27)
	- Distributive arrangement, partial, 1-1 correspondence
- Participants : 12 each of ( 7, 8, 9) y/o

### Results
- Both children and adults make errors in quantifier interpretation
- Only 9 y/o were consistent in identifying the quantifier properly
- 7 y/o preferred pictures with extra animals/objects rather than containers
- Better performance :
	- Children : If sentence has quantifier modifying the containers
	- Adults : Distributed between the others
- Bias to prefer locative scenes with all filled containers (Drozd (2001)) :
	- Children : Yes
	- Adults : No bias

### Discussion
- Replace Truth Value Judgement Task : allows rejection
- Contrasts with :
	- Crain et al. (1996) : near perfect performance of preschool children
	- Kang et al. (2001) : better performance when universal quantifier modifies the subject
- Problem : not in syntax but in difficulty of selecting the appropriate entity while avoiding distraction by other objects
	- To solve this problem : Instead of taxing limited processing capacities => engage in “shallow processing”=> Use simpler strategies aka Shortcutsc
