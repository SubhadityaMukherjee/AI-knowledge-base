# Change Blindness
- Difficulty detecting changes in separated scenes even after careful inspection
- Once found viewers agree that it was trivial
- Not due to limited visual acuity but inappropriate attentional guidance
- Temporal separation (instead of spatial)
- sudden changes within a static scene are easily perceived (cf. preattentiveness of motion)
- Change blindness also in animations if temporal separation spans multiple scenes
â€¢ A scene that should be the same but differs between cuts is known as continuity error
