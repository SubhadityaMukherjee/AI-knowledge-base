**Experiment 1: Working with Categorical Data**

Experiment 1 collected judgments about whether or not the picture matched the sentences presented to participants. Officially it's a picture verification task, but frequently these types of studies are also called Truth-Value Judgment Tasks. 

You will understand the experiment and the analysis best if you have done the experiment yourself. You can do the experiment at the following link:[](https://brightspace.rug.nl//content/enforced/80947-WMCC003-05.2022-2023.1/csfiles/home_dir/Lab1_Sentence_Examples.zip?_&d2lSessionVal=qodp53Z1d1P8nZkdeb54ar5zS&ou=80947)

**Tips on understanding the experiment**

In order to understand the motivation of the research and the context in which it was conducted, you need to know something about the previous work that has been done.

This work investigated how compatible sentences with numerically quantified subjects and objects are with distributive and collective situations, with and without the presence of the distributive quantifier "each". Classic works that are relevant to the experiment are  Brooks and Braine (1996), Musolino (2009) and Syrett and Musolino (2013). 

**What to submit:**

The goal is to eventually be able to easily analyze and write up experimental results for a topic you know something about. 

The format we will use is the CogSci conference submission template:

Choose full paper template. There is both a latex and a word template.

**Lab 1 submissions**

For Lab1, You should fill in the title, author and try to write an abstract that summarizes the research questions, the method and the results. You can leave out the Introduction, Background, Discussion, and Conclusions/Directions for Future Research. You will need a reference list but it will be quite short because for the Method and Results section, there are only a few likely references related to the statistical analysis used. 

Your main focus will be on the Method and Results sections. 

**What goes in the methods section?**

The methods section gives a kind of recipe for how to recreate the experiment. A key requirement of the documentation of scientific research is that the method has to be documented in enough detail that it can be replicated. Note however, that you do NOT need to included details that are no relevant to the results, or that other people will not have. For example, if you did an experiment and your computer kept breaking down, so you had to throw out some participants, then you would not include the details in the results. That's because it's irrelevant and it's also unlikely that other people will have similar problems. Instead, you can simply say that x number of participants could not complete the experiment due to technical difficulties and therefore their data was not analyzed. 

In the Methods section you will need to explain (1) what the experimental design was, (2) what the fixed factors were  (3) the method used and therefore the type of data collected, (4) the procedure, (5) the participants and their biographical features, etc. 

In linguistic experiments it's standard to include example sentences, describing their form, and examples of the pictures, also describing their form. People say "A picture's worth a thousand words" and I would say "An example sentence is worth 500".

The attached file contains all the images and sentences used in the lab. It's all in PHP, so you will to decipher it a bit if you want to use it. You are not expected to do so, but it can help you if you really want to understand it (or you can just take a pretty picture for your report!).

- The file sentences_distributivity_new.php contains arrays of all the possible items, the sentence and the image associated with it. The files inputN.php decide which of these items will be shown to a user in group N (identified in the lab data with ListNum). The order of items is shuffled.

**An initial motivation?**

You can begin the methods section with a very brief introduction of what type of research question you wanted to answer, continuing with "and for this reason we decided to test sentences like X" or something like that, but a methods section can also be quite bare bones, just the details of what was done. If you do add some sort of motivation, keep it very brief. 

**Predictions at the end of the** Method **section?**

Sometimes it makes sense, and makes it clear for the reader, if the method section ends with just a brief statement clarifying what results are expected for the proposed set-up, given previous experiments. On the other hand, many people like to keep the method very simple and will not include this. 

Personally, I like a clean method section. Instead, the background section should lead up to a motivation and a prediction at the end just before the Method section begins. But if you look at the papers associated with the course, you will find both types of Method sections. 

**The Results Section**

Here you should present the results of the experiment. You should first present data about if all participants finished the experiment and what the [[dataset.md|dataset]] is that you are then analyzing. After that, present the descriptive statistics, referring ideally to a diagram or figure. Descriptive statistics includes information about the mean acceptance rates, the standard deviation or other variation measurement and sometimes other things.

After the descriptive statistics, present the mixed effect model analysis. There are several examples both in the file and also in many of the papers. I strongly suggest you try to find several examples and compare them. 

Your results should include an informative figure (at least one). Please take care to formulate an informative caption for the Figure. Many people first glance through a paper looking at the figures. You want to make sure they can interpret what they see easily. 

**Reporting the Mixed Model Results:**

**Here's an example from a recent paper of mine:**

We analyzed the children's responses using logistic mixed-effect models (Baayen et al. 2008) and step-wise deletion procedure. AIC values were compared to determine which model fit the data best, with a complex model being preferred over a simpler model only if its AIC value is two ore more points lower. The fixed effects were Quantifier (all vs. only), Picture Type (Exhaustive  vs. Non-exhaustive) and the random effects of Participant, Item and Age (in days, normalized). We also tested both fixed effects as random slopes with all [[random factors]] (Jaeger 2008). The maximal model that explained significantly more variance retained the fixed factors Quantifier and Picture Type and the [[random factors]] Participant and Item only, with a significant interaction. The final model is presented in Appendix A, Table A.1.

Pairwise comparisons (Tukey) showed two significant interactions at the p<0.001 level: the "all" (al)-Exhaustive picture condition (24% "Yes" responses) had signfiicantly more "Yes" responses compared to the "only"(alleen)-Exhaustive picture condition (14% "yes" responses). The "all"(al)-Non-Exhaustive picture condition (14% "yes" responses) also had significantly fewer "Yes" responses compared to the "only" (alleen)-Non-exhaustive picture condition (26% "yes" responses). No other comparisons were significant.

**The appendix**

In the main results section you do not include the actual table output from the best model. But you should include this, and also any output from Post-hoc comparison tests, as tables in the appendix. Here again, watch your names. Below is an example of how you can present the model in the appendix. 

  

**![Example Table](https://brightspace.rug.nl//content/enforced/80947-WMCC003-05.2022-2023.1/Model_Presentation.jpg?_&d2lSessionVal=qodp53Z1d1P8nZkdeb54ar5zS&ou=80947 "Example Table")**

**A word about names**

In referring to factors you need to use consistent, clear names throughout the paper you write. Choose names that make it easy for the reader to follow your thoughts. Scientists are busy people. If you present results with names like "Factor 1" or with uninterpretable abbreviations such as "cll" for "Collective Pictures", they might stop reading. They won't go reread previous text to figure out what Factor 1 was. Your task as an author is to make the results as easy to follow as possible. 

The same goes for Figures. You need to make sure Figures are clearly labelled with interpretable names (and fonts that fit with the size of the rest of the text, please not super tiny!) It may be that you have trouble with the program you use for the figures to get the labels the way you like them. This has happened to me as well. My favorite fix for that is MS Paint. I simply write over too small text with something that readable. 

**Conclusions or commentary in the Results section?**

In presenting the results, and at the end of the results section you may want to add some commentary that helps the reader follow your thinking. Technically, this commentary is a kind of discussion of the results, but a very brief one. That's ok and can really help make a paper more readable. The kind of thing I mean is you may say something like "Participants accepted X at a significantly higher rate than Y in all conditions" and then you add ", consistent with previous research". Or "as expected". Just be careful that you don't get into a longer discussion.
