# MobileOne
- [An Improved One Millisecond Mobile Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04040)
- extensive analysis of different metrics by deploying several mobile friendly networks on a mobile device
- identify and analyze architectural and optimization bottlenecks
- many times faster on mobile
- Inspired by[RepVGG](RepVGG.qmd)
- Either [ReLU](Relu.qmd) or SE-[ReLU](Relu.qmd) is used as activation. The trivial over-parameterization factor $k$ is a hyperparameter which is tuned for every variant.
- better top-1 accuracy on [ImageNet](ImageNet.qmd) than [EfficientNet](EfficientNet.qmd) at similar latency
