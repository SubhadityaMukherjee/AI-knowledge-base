# [[Gravity]] Loading
- The [[Force|force]] exerted downward, due to the weight of the robot arm and/or the load at the end of the arm. The [[Force|force]] creates an error with respect to position accuracy of the end effector. A compensating [[Force|force]] can be computed and applied bringing the arm back to the desired position.
