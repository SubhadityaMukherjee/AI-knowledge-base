# [Bayesian](Bayesian.qmd) Predictive Posterior
- Follows from [Bayesian Posterior](Bayesian%20Posterior.qmd)
- Marginalizing over all possible model parameters w
- Computes predictions y with different model parameters w and weights them by the [Probability](Probability.qmd) of those params given an input x
- [Bayesian](Bayesian.qmd) Model Averaging
- $$P(y|x) = \int_{w}P(y|w,x)P(w|x)dx$$
