## Week 3 Lab Cogmod
- Foreperiod in ms
- 1/RT is normally distributed
- Effects : FP, reward, target visibility
- 3 FP x 2 re x 2 tv
- lmer : $$1/RT \sim fp*reward*tv$$
- Effect of FP
	- Faster if FP is longer
- Effect of reward
- Faster if TV is easy to see
- Interaction of TV : FP
	- Preparation related to TV
- If longer to prepare : more errors (longer FP)
	- RT might not always be a benefit
- If low visibility + reward + prepared : bad performance
	- not a lot of effect if no reward
- Effect of memory
	- Effects of duration of prev trials
	- Always memory search?
- Reward
	- Not searching back memory for too many trials
