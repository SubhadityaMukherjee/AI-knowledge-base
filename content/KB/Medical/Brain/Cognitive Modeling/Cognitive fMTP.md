# Cognitive fMTP

- Preparation effects manifest in the motor system
- Preparation is a balance between inhibition and activation
- A neural representation of time  
- A (crude) model of the motor system  
- Hebbian associations + Forgetting & Retrieval

## Between Fore and Start
- Timing
	- Layer of time cells
	- ![[Pasted image 20221205141639.png]]
- Preparation
	- The motor system ‘stages’ a response, but holds it under inhibition..
	- When the Go-stimulus (S2) arrives: activation
	- ![[Pasted image 20221205141650.png]]

## Learning
- Different 'Time cells' and 'motor inhibiton & activation' are active at the same time: this leads to hebbian learning
- Fire together, wire together
- Forms memory traces : aka chunk

## Retrieval
- At the start, high degree of inhibition and low degree of activation
- If prev trial is short, inhibition short and more activation
- $$RT = \frac{I}{A}$$
- More activation retrieved : faster
- Recency weighted
- [[Declarative Memory Blending]]
- Preparation := Ratio of retrieved I vs. A

## Vs ACT-R
- Prepare for ‘the right moment’  
	- Moment-to-moment balance of I and A  
- ‘the right moment’ is estimated based on time (pulses) and memory (DM)  
	- Similar; but memory ‘chunks’ contain I- and A-traces not a single moment at which one should be prepared  
- If we are prepared→ benefit, else cost  
	- [[Scaled benefits]]  
	- Inhibiton increases RT; activation decreases RT  
- No active process during timing  
	- Continuously retrieving associated memories?  
- Once we are prepared, it doesn’t ‘go away’  
	- Consequence of ‘more A, less I retrieved’
