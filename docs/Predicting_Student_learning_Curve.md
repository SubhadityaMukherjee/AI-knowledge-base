# Predicting Student Learning Curve
```toc
```

- (Croteau, Heffernan, & Koedinger, 2004).
- The learning curve of a [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md) graphs the durations of its learning events (or their probability of error).
- a learning curve should be a smoothly descending power-law or exponential curve
- For instance, the first [Learning_Event](Learning_Event.md) for a [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md) may take 50 seconds, because the student is constructing the [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md) by referring to the textbook and asking the tutoring system for help. The next [Learning_Event](Learning_Event.md) might take only 25 seconds because the student is reconstructing the [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md). On the third [Learning_Event](Learning_Event.md), the student recalls the [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md) after a brief struggle, so the event takes 12 seconds. The fourth event takes 6 seconds, the fifth takes 3 seconds, and so on. However, if the representation of knowledge is inaccurate, a [Knowledge_Component](Knowledge_Component.md)'s learning curve may have a huge jump in the middle or be quite jagged
