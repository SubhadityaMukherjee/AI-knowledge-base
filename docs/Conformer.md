# Conformer
- [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100)
- [Transformer](Transformer.md) models are good at capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs exploit local [features](Features.md) effectively
- integrating components from both CNNs and Transformers for end-to-end speech recognition to model both local and global dependencies of an audio sequence in a parameter-efficient way
- importance of each component, and demonstrated that the inclusion of convolution modules is critical to the performance of the Conformer model
- propose the convolution-augmented [transformer](Transformer.md) for speech recognition, named Conformer
- [LibriSpeech](LibriSpeech.md)
