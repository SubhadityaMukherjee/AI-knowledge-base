# Chapter 5 - Loss functions
```toc
```
- A large list of useful loss functions can be found if you search for loss on the KB
- A loss function or cost function L[φ] returns a single number that describes the mismatch between the model predictions f[xi, φ] and their corresponding ground-truth outputs $y_i$
