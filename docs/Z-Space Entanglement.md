# Z-Space Entanglement
```toc
```
- Another challenge with controllable generation is referred to as entanglement in Z-space.
- When the z-space is entangled, this means movement in different directions has an effect on multiple features in the output simultaneously.
- Even if these features aren't correlated, an entangled z-space results in a single feature change modifying more than one feature in the output.
- Entanglement happens commonly if the number of dimensions in the z-space isn't large enough
