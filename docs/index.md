## Welcome!
- This is my little knowledge base
- If there is something you are looking for, just type it into the search bar
	- Of course, since this is not google, it is not a one stop shop
	- In essence, it will have something on things that I learn
- The topics you might find are
	- Deep learning
	- Machine learning
	- Statistics
	- Neuroscience
	- Robotics
	- Scientific Visualization
	- Language

## Site Tweaks
- if you wait for a few seconds, related links to the page you are on show up (if they exist)
	- It is my replacement for the graph structure that Obsidian follows
	- Maybe one day I will re implement the graph on the website, until thenâ€¦.
