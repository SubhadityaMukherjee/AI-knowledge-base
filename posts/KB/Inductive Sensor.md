# Inductive Sensor
- The class of proximity sensors, which has half of a ferrite core, whose coil is part of an oscillator circuit. When a metallic object enters this field, at some point, the object will absorb enough energy from the field to cause the oscillator to stop oscillating. This signifies that an object is present in a given proximity.
