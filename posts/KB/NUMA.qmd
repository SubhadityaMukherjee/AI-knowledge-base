# NUMA
- Shared memory
- Often made by physically linking two or more [SMP](SMP.qmd)
- One [SMP](SMP.qmd) can directly access memory of another [SMP](SMP.qmd)
- Not all processors have equal access time to all memories
- Memory access across link is slower
- [Cache Coherence](Cache%20Coherence.qmd)
