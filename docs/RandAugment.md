# RandAugment
- [Augmentation](Augmentation.md)
- [Issues](Issues.md)
	- separate search phase
	- unable to adjust the [Regularization](Regularization.md) strength based on model or dataset size
	- training small models on small datasets and subsequently applied to train larger models
- simple parameterization for targeting [augmentation](Augmentation.md) to particular model and dataset sizes
- [CIFAR](CIFAR.md), [COCO](COCO.md), [SVHN](SVHN.md), [ImageNet](ImageNet.md)
- interpretable hyperparameter
