# ResizeMix

- @qinResizeMixMixingData2020
- performs random image [cropping](cropping.qmd) and pasting
- ResizeMix solves the random region [cropping](cropping.qmd) problem that misallocates the output image label in certain cases where the pasted region does not contain any object informa- tion
- scaling down (scale rate is sampled from a uniform dis- tribution) the selected image completely and past- ing it randomly on the target image
- modified labels of the output image are always accurate and proportionate to the mixing.
