# Manifold MixUp
- mixes feature values generated from intermediate neural network layers.
- feedforward up to k layer of the network where the output feature maps are mixed
- The mixed feature maps are given input to the next layer and forward propagated up to the last layer.
- After the forward propagation, backward propagation is performed in the standard way with updated labels
