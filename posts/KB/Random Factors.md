# Random Factors
- These are factors that can affect the outcome that we do not design, and cannot control
- Two common types
- Participant
	- People differ. Some people are very strict. Some people accept everything.
- Item
	- Some sentences are weird with monkeys. Some situations are hard to draw so the picture is a bit odd.
- When we analyze the data we have to take into account that there will be variation present because of these random factors.
