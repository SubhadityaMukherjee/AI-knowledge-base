- **07:01** Just doing a crash course on Neuroscience. Dont have much brain power left so just doing what I feel like. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPix_X-9t7E&list=PLOA0aRJ90NxuIgOC9YGRUT4Y-CsP12bsS&index=1)
- **07:48** Now Im adding physics equations. I dunno why. But I feel like learning random stuff and remembering things from school. I cant remember everything but just putting things here seems like a nice thing.
