# Trustworthiness
```toc
```

- However, declaring a model as explainable as per its capabilities of inducing trust might not be fully compliant with the requirement of model explainability
- Trustworthiness might be considered as the confidence of whether a model will act as intended when facing a given problem
- it does not imply that every trustworthy model can be considered explainable on its own, nor is trustworthiness a property easy to quantify
- Trust might be far from being the only purpose of an explainable model since the relation among the two, if agreed upon, is not reciprocal
