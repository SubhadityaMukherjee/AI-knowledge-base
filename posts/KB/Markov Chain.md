# Markov Chain
- Sequence of random variables such as $X_{n+1}$ only depends on $X_{n}$
- Discrete time
- Stochastic process without memory
- Finite interval : [0, 1, … n]
- Right infinite : n = 1, 2, 3, …
- Left right infinite : Integers
	- No start
- [Markov Initial Distribution](Markov%20Initial%20Distribution.md)
- [Markov Transition Kernel](Markov%20Transition%20Kernel.md)
