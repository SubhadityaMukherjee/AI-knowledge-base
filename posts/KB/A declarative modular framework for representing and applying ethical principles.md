# A Declarative Modular Framework for Representing and Applying Ethical Principles.


- Fiona Berreby, Gauvain Bourgne, and JeanGabriel Ganascia
- high level action language for designing ethical agents in an attempt to shift the burden of moral reasoning to the autonomous agents
- collects action, event and situation information to enable an agent to simulate the outcome of various courses of actions
- event traces are then passed to the causal engine to produce causal traces
- ethical specifications and priority of ethical considerations under a given situation are used to compute the goodness assessment on the consequences
- combined with deontological specifications (duties, obligations, rights) to produce a final rightfulness assessment
