# Chain of Thought
- [Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)
- ability of [language](language.md) models to generate a coherent chain of thought
- series of short sentences that mimic the reasoning process a person might have when responding to a question
- the more complex the task of interest is (in the sense of requiring multi-step reasoning approach), the bigger the boost from the chain of thought prompting!
- chain of thought processing is an emergent property of model scale that can be induced via prompting and can enable sufficiently large [language](language.md) models to better perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have flat scaling curves.
