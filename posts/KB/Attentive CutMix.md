# Attentive [[CutMix.md|CutMix]]
- @walawalkarAttentiveCutMixEnhanced2020
- builds up on [[CutMix.md|CutMix]] .
- Instead of random pasting, it identifies attentive patches for [[cutout.md|cutout]] and pastes them at the same location in the other image.
- avoids the problem of selecting a background region not important for the network and updating the label information
- A separate pre-trained network is employed to extract attentive regions.
- The attention output is mapped back onto the original image
