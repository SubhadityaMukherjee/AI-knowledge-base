# [Attention](Attention.md.md) Based Distillation
- That is to say, knowledge about feature embedding is transferred using [attention](Attention.md.md) map functions. Unlike the [attention](Attention.md.md) maps, a different attentive knowledge distillation method was proposed by Song et al. (2018). An [attention](Attention.md.md) mechanism is used to assign different confidence rules (Song et al., 2018).
