- # Adaptive Whitening Saliency
- [@Adaptive deconvolutional networks for mid and high level feature learning](@Adaptive%20deconvolutional%20networks%20for%20mid%20and%20high%20level%20feature%20learning.md)
- is based on the whitening of low-level features and has shown good performance for saliency map estimation.
- uses the features extracted by the model pre-trained for scene recognition.
