# Tutor


- However, a tutoring system does not have to replace a teacher or run an after-school remediation session
- Its role in the student's learning ecology can be anythingâ€”a smart piece of paper; an encouraging coach; a stimulating peer, etc. The technology is quite neutral
- For instance, tutoring systems have been built that do not teach their task domain at all, but instead encourage students to discover its principles (e.g., Shute & Glaser, 1990).
