# ABN AMRO Motivation Letter - Subhaditya



During COVID, it became increasingly clear just how important it was to have stable financial systems. At the end of the day, no matter what position you work in in the financial sector, it is important to consider the customers that will be affected by the pipeline. Even small-scale bank frauds can affect a large number of people. Growing up, I heard many stories of such cases and how many people lost their livelihoods because of financial crime. Back then, of course, I could do nothing about it. But now I have a small chance of contributing to the fight for financial safety, and I want to take it.

A while back, I had the privilege of doing an internship at Emirates NBD, one of the biggest banks in the UAE. There I was involved in a project to build a similar system to detect financial fraud. I helped build the ETL pipelines and ML models to identify load defaulters and also generate forecasts of how much customers might be able to pay based on their historical records. I learned quite a bit about the proceedings there. It has been a few years since that internship, and I have completed my Masters in Artificial Intelligence as of last month. That being the case, I am now more prepared to tackle the challenges that this job might bring about.

I hope to contribute to this and any future projects to the best of my abilities. It would be good to give customers a bit more peace of mind by helping create such systems.
