# Adversarial Spatial [Dropout](Dropout.md.md) for Occlusion
- Crops region pixels to generate hard positives for object detection by learning key image regions
- Within the proposed region only 1/3 pixels are dropped after sorting based on magnitudes
- Dropped values are non-contiguous here as compared to previously discussed methods
