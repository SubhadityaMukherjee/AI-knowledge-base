# Andes

- Outer loop: The Andes physics tutoring system (<http://www.andes.pitt.edu/)> helps students learn how to solve physics problems (K. VanLehn et al., 2005; K. VanLehn et al., 2002).
- Inner loop: The student solves the problem by making steps similar to the ones they would make if solving the problem with pencil and paper. One kind of step is to type an equation into one of the numbered boxes in the right window. Another kind of step is to draw a Cartesian coordinate system, such as the one showing in the lower left. A third kind of step is to sketch a vector, then fill out a dialogue box that defines it. A vector-drawing operation was in progress at the time the screen shot was taken, so its dialogue box covers part of the screen.
- Every time the student makes a step, Andes gives immediate feedback. For most types of steps, Andes merely colors the step green if it is correct and red if it is incorrect.
- Step analysis: Like the [[Algebra Cognitive Tutor]], Andes analyzes non-equation steps by precomputing anticipated steps and matching the student's step against them
- However, this method does not work for the equation steps because there are too many anticipated equations to generate

>   - It is likely that the student wants a hint on how to do that step correctly. If the tutor can determine which correct step corresponds to the incorrect step entered by the student, then it can safely hint that correct step. On the other hand, if the tutor cannot determine which correct step corresponds to the student's step, the tutor may ask the student what step they were trying to enter. [[Andes]] does this for unrecognizable equations that the student wants help on.

>   - For instance, when students solve physics problems on [[Andes]], they can enter an equation that is true of the given physical situation but is not necessary for solving the problem.
>   - Immediate feedback: [[Andes]], [[Algebra Cognitive Tutor]], [[Steve]] and [[AutoTutor]] give feedback immediately after each student step. They vary considerably in how the feedback is presented.
>   - To ameliorate into slips and potential this, [[Andes]] divides error misunderstandings. types
>   - When a student enters an incorrect step that is classified as a slip, then [[Andes]] gives the error specific remediation immediately, e.g., You forgot to include a unit on a number. If the error is classified as a potential misunderstanding, then [[Andes]] merely turns the incorrect step red, and lets the student ask for an error-specific hint if they want one.
