# Threaded Cognition
```toc
```

- Aka no real "switch" between one task to next but bottlenecks
- Cognition is Threaded but overlaps in the sense that different areas can not be accessed if it uses same areas as the other task at the same time
- If no expertise, consult Declarative memory all the time. Until it's not required anymore if in long term store.
