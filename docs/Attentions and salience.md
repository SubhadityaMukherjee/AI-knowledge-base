# Attentions and Salience
- Learning is related to [[Attention|attention]]
- We give more [[Attention|attention]] to salient items
- Selective [[Attention|attention]] leads to overshadowing
- Two cues presented together jointly predict outcomes
- salience (and then [[Attention|attention]]) leads to one cue being strongly associated
- ther cue is only weakly associated (overshadowed)
- Overshadowing leads to blocking
- Blocking could model interference
- Children learn temporal adverbs like hier late (Dale and Fenson 1996)
- L2 learners go through phases where time is marked with adverbials alone (Bardovi-Harlig 1992; Meisel 1987)
- This seems to block acquisition of other cues
- temporal adverbs are highly salient (and easier) so they get stronger associations
- even though they co-occur with different [[Verb|verb]] forms, these are hard to learn
