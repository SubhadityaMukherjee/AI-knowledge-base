# Particle [[Visualization]]
- points with only a (3D) coordinate
â€¢ potentially enriched with attributes like radius, velocity, etc.
- scattered data [[Data Structures]]
- lack of topological information (neighborhood)
- typically many particles  (e.g. atoms, galaxies)
- Atomistic [[visualization]]
- via glyphs (i.e. spheres)
- explicit (geometry) or implicit [[Raycasting]]
- Surface-based [[visualization]]
- extract surface geometry
- particles: point samples describing a surface (e.g. in fluids or molecules)
- Volume-based [[visualization]]
- particles: point samples of a volume
- [[raycasting]] and hierarchical [[data structures]]
