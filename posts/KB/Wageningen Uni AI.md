# Wageningen : Researcher Computer Vision Technology for Animal Science

With the demands on the food industry growing every day, it is easy for companies to start ignoring the needs of the animals that are the most significant part of the pipeline. We hear so many horror stories about the conditions some of these animals face, but even more humane places have to meet many needs. On a larger scale, using technologies like AI can make it much less labor-intensive to provide suitable conditions for these animals and make sure they live as close to their original lives in nature as possible. That being said, the intersection between computer vision and animal welfare is quite interesting to me, hence this application.

As of a month ago, I have a masters in AI from the University of Groningen. My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision for practical applications. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. I am comfortable with building deep learning pipelines, image and data analysis, OpenCV applications, image processing, etc. 

In any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing solutions that have a positive impact, and I can contribute quite a bit to any team I get the chance to work with. If there is anything I do not know, I am also ready to develop those skills quickly. I hope you give me a chance to work on providing better conditions for animals in this industry.
