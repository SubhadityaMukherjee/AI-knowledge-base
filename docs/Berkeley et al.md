# Berkeley Et Al
- 576 input patterns
- 5793 epochs needed to reach convergence
- Model frozen, stimulus set presented again
- Activation of each hidden unit recorded
- [[Single unit recording]]
- Why do these bands appear?
- Gaussian activation function
- But banding patterns have been found with sigmoidal activation as well
- Effect = units only respond to a limited number of inputs
- Bands appear when weights into HUs cancel each other out
- Activations of hidden neurons can be organized into bands
- Bands are associated with interpretable [features](Features.md)
- Lesion studies show bands are essential to solving problem
- For some problems under some circumstances, neural networks develop highly selective hidden units
- Looks like localist coding (grandmother cells)
- Patterns of activation can be ambiguous on their own
- But realistically, more than one pattern might be activated simultaneously
- Superimposing two or more patterns over same units leads to an ambiguous blend
- Problem for localist representations, but even more serious with distributed representations
