# CogMod Final Paper
```toc
```
- [[The Reward Experiment]]
- An ACT-R model that explains at least one of these effects (well)  
- Report to justify design choices
- ‘cognitive’ interpretation, that is justifiable & plausible

## To test
- linear decrease in goal activation 
## Papers
- [[Sequential effects within a short foreperiod context: Evidence for the conditioning account of temporal preparation]] : The sequential effects and fanning. But properly
- [[Traces of times past: Representations of temporal intervals in memory]] : Explain the fanning effect
- [[The warning stimulus as retrieval cue: The role of associative memory in temporal preparation]] : temporal preparation , sloping effects
- [[Modeling motivation using goal competition in mental fatigue studies]] : performance in reward vs non reward , distraction, linear decrease in goal activation
- [[The neural correlates of mental fatigue and reward processing: A task-based fMRI study]] : studies the physical brain effect of reward and fatigue
- [[Implicitly learning when to be ready: From instances to categories]] : fanning , maybe the graphs can also be explained by categorical association instead of just instance based
- [[On the Distinction Between Perceived Duration and Event Timing: Towards a Unified Model of Time Perception]] : brain uses temporal expectations to bias perception in a way that stimuli are ‘regularized’
- [[Change of VariableForeperiod Effects within an Experiment: A Bayesian Modeling Approach]] : sequential modulation, which is attributed to feature binding and retrieval by the BRAC framework, could have different underlying mechanisms depending on the task scenario.
