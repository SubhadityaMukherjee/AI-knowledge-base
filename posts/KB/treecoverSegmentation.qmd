# Tree Cover Segmentation
- treecover segmentation [PointNet++](PointNet++.qmd)
	- Data collected from above
	- Normalization : height, xy
	- Rotation
	- Jiggling ??
	- Labeling
		- ![im](images/Pasted%20image%2020220318094643.png) Segmentation algorithm. Canopy hide model
		- Weighted [loss](loss.qmd) + [Focal Loss](Focal%20Loss.qmd)

## 2d Methods
- [Watershed](Watershed) + [Unet](Unet.qmd)

	- $\Theta$ is just clippingpng]
	- The sqrt makes it a little smoother
