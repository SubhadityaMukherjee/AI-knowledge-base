# Eager Execution
- A TensorFlow programming environment in which operations run immediately. By contrast, operations called in graph execution don't run until they are explicitly evaluated. Eager execution is an imperative interface , much like the code in most programming languages. Eager execution programs are generally far easier to debug than graph execution programs.
