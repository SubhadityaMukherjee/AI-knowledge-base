# Focal Loss
- two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations.
- In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, [dense](Dense.qmd) [sampling](Sampling.qmd) of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far.
- Extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of [dense](Dense.qmd) detectors is the central cause
- modulating term to [Cross Entropy](Cross%20Entropy.qmd) in order to focus learning on hard misclassified examples
- scaling factor decays to zero as confidence in the correct class increases
- training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training
- [RetinaNet](RetinaNet.qmd)
