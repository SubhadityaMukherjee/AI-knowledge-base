# Simple Gradient Descent
- $$\theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$$
- It starts with some coefficients, sees their cost, and searches for cost value lesser than what it is now.
- It moves towards the lower weight and updates the value of the coefficients.
- The process repeats until the local minimum is reached. A local minimum is a point beyond which it can not proceed.
