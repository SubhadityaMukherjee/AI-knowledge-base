# Non [[Relational Inductive Bias]]
- [[ActivationFunctions]]
	- allow the model to capture the non-linearity hidden in the data
- [[Dropout]]
	- helps the network avoid memorizing the data by forcing random subsets of the network to each learn the data pattern. As a result, the obtained model, in the end, is able to generalize better
- [[Weight Decay]]
	- puts constraints on the modelâ€™s weights
- [[Batch Normalization]] , [[Layer Normalization]] , [[Instance Normalization]]
	- Reduces [[Covariate Shift]]
- [[Augmentation]]
- [[Optimizers]]
