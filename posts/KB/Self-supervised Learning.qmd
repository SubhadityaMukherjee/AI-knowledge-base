## Self-supervised Learning
- Compared to supervised learning methods which require a data pair Xi and Yi while Yi is annotated by human labors, self-supervised learning also trained with data Xi along with its pseudo label Pi while Pi is automatically generated for a pre-defined pretext task without involving any human annotation 
- The pseudo label Pi can be generated by using attributes of images or videos such as the context of images [18], [19], [20], [36], or by traditional hand-designed methods [49], [50], [51].

- As long as the pseudo labels P are automatically generated without involving human annotations, then the methods belong to self-supervised learning.
