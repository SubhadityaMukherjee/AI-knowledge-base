# Action Potential
- Sometimes called a “spike” or described as a neuron “firing,” an action potential occurs when there is a significant increase in the electrical activity along the membrane of a nerve cell. It is associated with neurons passing electrochemical messages down the [axon](Axon.md), releasing neurotransmitters to neighboring cells in the synapse.
