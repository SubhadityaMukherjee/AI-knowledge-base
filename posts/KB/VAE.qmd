# Variational Autoencoder
- Some control over distribution of learned [features](Features.qmd)
- Eg: Decoder as a generative model
- Constraint [loss](loss.qmd) function and a given [Probability](Probability.qmd) $\mathcal{D}$
	- Eg: By [Loss](loss.qmd) func [KL Divergence](KL%20Divergence.qmd) and prob distribution $$L(X) = n^{-1}\Sigma_i||x_i - D(E(\tilde x))||^2 + \lambda \cdot KL(f_i, d)$
	- Use 2D unit distribution. 0 mean, unit variance
	- Latent vector : $$f=\mu + \epsilon e^{2log\sigma}$$
- $$L(X) = n^{-1}\Sigma_i||x_i - D(E(\tilde x))||^2 + \frac{1}{2n}\Sigma_i(e^{log\sigma(x_i)} + \mu(x_i)^2 -1 -log(\sigma (x_i))$
- Encoder predicts mean and std $$E(x_i) = (\mu(x_i) , log \sigma(x_i))$$
