# Wickelphones
- Pro: capture just enough info about the context that determines irregular past-tense [verb](Verb.md) forms ense verbs, e.g.sing -sang, ring -rang
- 1 wickelphone = 1 input unit and 1 output unit, connection matrix of 42875 * 42875!!
- Instead, reduce wickelphones to wickelfeatures (1210), where each wickelphone becomes 16 [features](Features.md)
- Verbs with same stem and [past tense](past%20tense.md)
- English has many verbs where the past and stem are the same:
	- put, fit, spread
- Usually verbs ending with -t or -d are likely have no-change
- Model also started to let the past be the same as the stem
- Verbs with vowel change
- Model made two errors older children have been shown to make: 1. stem + ed, e.g. comed, singed 2. past-form + ed, e.g. camed, sanged
- Does not explain differences in response times between irregular and regular verbs
- Models production only, not comprehension
- You can't reverse the model like you can reverse a rule
- Model can't generalize
- Computational models (Rule-based, Connectionist and MBL) all use adult vocabulary as input to simulate children's learning
- Children don't show vocabulary burst between State 2 and 3 (needed to produce U-shaped learning with Connectionist Model)
- Thousands of exposures
- No distinction between tokens and types, each [verb](Verb.md) simply included once
