# dGSLM
- [Generative Spoken Dialogue Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16502)
- dGSLM
- first “textless” model able to generate audio samples of naturalistic spoken dialogues
- unsupervised spoken unit discovery coupled with a dual-[tower](Tower.md) [transformer](Transformer.md) architecture with cross-[attention](Attention.md) trained on 2000 hours of two-channel raw conversational audio [Fisher Spanish-English](Fisher%20Spanish-English.md) without any text or labels
- generate speech, laughter and other paralinguistic signals in the two channels simultaneously and reproduces naturalistic turn taking
