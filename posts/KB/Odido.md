# Subhaditya Mukherjee : Odido - Data Scientist Application

    

Hello Pauline,

It's nice to meet you!Â 

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found the position a good fit for what I can offer and what I want to do next, and so this is my formal application for the Data Scientist position.

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I have a mix of experience - from ML (scikit-learn, xgboost, pandas) to advanced Gen AI (LLMs, Diffusion models) to the stack of Python, Git, Docker etc. I have been working with AI for a long time now, and am quite familiar with the stack, something that I think would be a good fit in this position.

My main background is in R&D, and so the Intelligence and Insights division is where I think I see myself in the most. I love a good challenge, and getting to work on a product that will affect so many people is such a nice opportunity.
