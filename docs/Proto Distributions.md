# Proto Distributions
- [[Distributions]]
- Occur in [[Bayesian]]

## Continuous Spaces
- [[Proto PDF]]
- $$p(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}p_{0}(x| \theta)dx}p_{0}(x|\theta)$$
- $p_{0}$ gives the shape of the [[pdf]]
- $\frac{1}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}p_{0}(x| \theta)dx}$  is a normalization so it integrates to 1

- Most of the time we dont know a distribution but only its proto distribution. This is actually enough sometimes
