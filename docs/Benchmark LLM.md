# Benchmark LLM
- [Large Language Models Still Canâ€™t Plan (A Benchmark for LLMs on Planning and Reasoning about Change)](A%20Benchmark%20for%20LLMs%20on%20Planning%20and%20Reasoning%20about%20Change))
- The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP)
- From [GPT3](GPT3.md) to [PaLM](PaLM.md), the state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks is being pushed forward with every new large language model
- current benchmarks are relatively simplistic and the performance over these benchmarks cannot be used as an evidence to support
- extensible assessment framework motivated by the above gaps in current benchmarks to test the abilities of LLMs on a central aspect of human intelligence, which is reasoning about actions and change
- multiple test cases
