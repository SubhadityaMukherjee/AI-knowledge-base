# Familar Object Grasping Object Viiew Recog
- Shafii, Nima, S. Hamidreza Kasaei, and Luís Seabra Lopes. "Learning to grasp familiar objects using object view recognition and template matching." IROS 2016.
- Grasp template :
- Local shape feature for graspable regions
	- spin-image feature
- Global feature, the radius (distance from the CoM to the selected keypoint)
	- important to represent a stable grasp
 - Finger configuration
- New objects that are similar to known ones (i.e. they are familiar) can be grasped in a similar way
	- As an example, if the robot knows how to grasp a pen, it may use the same grasp temple to take a marker
