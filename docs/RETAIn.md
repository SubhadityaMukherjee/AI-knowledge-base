- REverse Time AttentIoN mechanism
- The approach mimics physician practice by attending to the EHR data. Two RNNs are trained in a reverse time order with the goal of efficiently generating the appropriate attention variables. It is based on a two-level neural attention generation process that detects influential past visits and significant clinical variables to improve accuracy and interpretability.
- for application to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
