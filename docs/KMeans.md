# K Means
- Codebook vectors. No manifolds.
- Given: $$(x_i)_{i= 1,..,N} \in \mathbb{R}^n$$
- Need : K clusters $$C_1 , â€¦ , C_K$$
- Randomly assign training points to K sets : $$S_j (j = 1, â€¦, K)$$
- Repeat:
	- For each set $$S_j$$
		- Mean $$\mu_j = |S_j|^{-1} \Sigma_{x \in S_j} x$$
		- Create new sets by putting points into set where $||x_i-\mu_j||$ is minimal
		- If empty, dismiss and reduce K to K'
- Error quantity does not increase
	- [[Intra cluster variance]]
	- Clusters are bounded by line [[Decision Boundaries]] and forms a [[Voronoi Cell]]
- Does not work for curved boundaries

## Codebook Vector
- Each cluster represented by it
- Vector pointing to the mean of all vectors in the cluster
- Center of [[gravity]]
