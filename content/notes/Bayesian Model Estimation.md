# [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) Model Estimation
- Unlike [frequentist](Frequentist.md), sometimes things like sample mean is not a good metric because it has a high variance. Might give different results with different trials in a real valued distribution
- The task is to estimate $\theta$ from the data
- [Bayesian Prior](Bayesian%20Prior.md)
- Now there are two sources of info about the true distribution $p_{X}(\theta)$
	- The likelihood $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)$ of $\theta$ . Empirical data
	- Prior plausibility in $h(\theta)$
	- Since these are independant sources we can combine them by multiplication: $p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)$
		- High values -> Candidate model $\theta$ is a good estimate
		- [Bayesian Posterior](Bayesian%20Posterior.md)
		- [Posterior Mean estimate](Posterior%20Mean%20estimate.md)

## Advantages
- If priors are well chosen -> Better than frequentists with small sample sizes

## Disadvantages
- Integrating over millions of params and performing multiple preds for each param -> infeasible
- How to encode or represent [Bayesian Posterior](Bayesian%20Posterior.md) as very high dim
	- No closed form representation over weights
	- Represent data with histograms and use [Monte Carlo](Monte%20Carlo)

## Example

- Green : prior , Red: Posterior
- The [Posterior Mean estimate](Posterior%20Mean%20estimate.md) is obtained by integrating $\int_{\mathbb{R}}\mu h(\mu|D)d\mu$
- Since this is different from sample mean -> Prior distribution really does influence the models
