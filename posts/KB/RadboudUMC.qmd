# FAIR Software Engineer Application

    

Hello! (I want to say James, but I am not sure)

My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am now looking for a job in the Netherlands. As a software engineer with an interest in healthcare and experience in AI, the FAIR RSE position seemed like the perfect next step for me, and I did not want to miss out on applying for it. Having been working on computer vision for a few years now, I am very aware of the need for better data management, especially for complex and privacy oriented workflows. I would love to bring this experience to DIAG, while also hopefully learning a lot from the team there too.

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI and data projects to life. My experience includes working with large datasets, building ML/DL models and pipelines and also sharing my knowledge with my peers in technical and non technical fields. I have worked with AWS, Google Cloud and DICOM before as well. I am quite proficient in Python, CI/CD and integrating 3rd party APIs with existing codebases. 

I have a masters in AI (with my thesis being on Explainable AI) and that also brought me  experience with setting up training and also the FAIR principles. More importantly though, using AI in healthcare has been my motivation for many years now, and one of the reasons I got into the field in the first place. That being the case, I feel like I am in a better position compared to general software engineers in understanding what is required and why.

This letter is getting a little long, but I did want to add that I would love to contribute to your team’s mission of making Radboud UMC the best campus for AI research, and in turn helping a lot of researchers get their work done faster and more responsibly. I do hope you give me a shot :)

Best,

Subhaditya Mukherjee
