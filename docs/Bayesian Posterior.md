# [[Bayesian]] Posterior
- When D is fixed though, this becomes a function of Model Candidates
- Non negative on K dim param space
- Not a [[pdf]] but if we divide it by its integral -> [[pdf]] . 
	- $$\frac{p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^K}p_{\otimes_{i}}x(D|\theta)h(\theta)d\theta}$$
	- Prob distrib over candidate models
- If the denominator is replaced written as $p(D)$ then it looks like the [[Bayes Rule]]
- Shape : $P(D|\theta)h(\theta)$ 
	- Integral not 1
	- [[Proto Distributions]] on $\theta$ space
