- A method of coordinating the movement of the joints, such that all joints arrive at the desired location simultaneously. This method of [servo control](Servo%20Control.md) produces a predictable path regardless of speed and results in the fastest [pick and place cycle](Pick%20and%20Place%20Cycle.md) time for a particular move.
