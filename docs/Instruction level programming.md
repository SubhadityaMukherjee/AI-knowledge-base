# Instruction Level Programming
- ILP
- allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed
- [[Instruction Pipelining]]
- [[SuperScalar]]
- [[Out of Order Execution]]
- [[Register Renaming]]
- [[Speculative Execution]]
- [[Branch Prediction]]

## Backlinks
> - [SuperScalar](SuperScalar.md)
>   - A superscalar CPU architecture implements [[Instruction level programming]] inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate.
