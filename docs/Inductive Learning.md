# Inductive Learning
- [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) is inductive learning
- Learning is identifying which hypothesis set is a concept
- Hypotheses don't disappear, they just become less likely
- Learning develops through more experience
- One challenge of [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) learning is that any small subset is consistent with many hypotheses
- Different hypotheses have different likelihoods based on the examples we are exposed to
- But in the end we also prefer smaller hypotheses over larger ones: The size principle
- Simple [clustering](Clustering.md) methods can be used to get the data to automatically create the hypothesis space needed for [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) modelling
- Probabilities of different sets then match with human judgments surprisingly well
- [Clustering](Clustering.md) based on biology worked worse!
- [Clustering](Clustering.md) using linguistic co-occurrences with latent semantic analysis also worked worse!
- Human subject judgements of similarity worked best
- Suggests some human reasoning relies on [probability](Probability.md)
- [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) learning can also learn categories
- Models are capable of making generalizations about the specific objects as well as the appropriate generalizations about categorization (superordinate categories!) in general.
- Advanced learning means learn constraints on what is a possible hypothesis
- Hierarchical [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) Modelling (HBM) can explain how we acquire [overhypotheses](Overhypotheses.md)
- using observations from the lowest level (data) and calculating statistical inferences
