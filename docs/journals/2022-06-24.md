- **12:16** I have spent the past 1.5 hours cleaning up the notes, adding some tags, linking some stuff
	- New shortcut for a random file is control+shift+b
	- I mostly have two major tasks today (maybe 3)
		- Seeing if I have comments on the CCN paper and fixing those(not sure if i can today)
		- Learning some more about transformers and preparing some more for the talk
		- Working on the paper that I have thrown to the corner
	- I also want to focus on drawing a little more today. There are some things I want to try.
		- I want to first pick any game. Look at their wiki for descriptions of the background. And design my own with that. Free prompts but not vague enough to get me annoyed. I think that is a good way to start. The question is. What game? Maybe some hack and slash types?
