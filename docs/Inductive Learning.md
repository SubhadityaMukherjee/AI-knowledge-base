# Inductive Learning
- [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) is inductive learning
- Learning is identifying which hypothesis set is a concept
- Hypotheses don't disappear, they just become less likely
- Learning develops through more experience
- One challenge of Bayesian learning is that any small subset is consistent with many hypotheses
- Different hypotheses have different likelihoods based on the examples we are exposed to
- But in the end we also prefer smaller hypotheses over larger ones: The size principle
- Simple clustering methods can be used to get the data to automatically create the hypothesis space needed for Bayesian modelling
- Probabilities of different sets then match with human judgments surprisingly well
- Clustering based on biology worked worse!
- Clustering using linguistic co-occurrences with latent semantic analysis also worked worse!
- Human subject judgements of similarity worked best
- Suggests some human reasoning relies on probability
- Bayesian learning can also learn categories
- Models are capable of making generalizations about the specific objects as well as the appropriate generalizations about categorization (superordinate categories!) in general.
- Advanced learning means learn constraints on what is a possible hypothesis
- Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling (HBM) can explain how we acquire overhypotheses
- using observations from the lowest level (data) and calculating statistical inferences
