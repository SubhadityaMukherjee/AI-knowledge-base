## About
- Keep your viewers engaged to your platform along with every step of their journey
- Create new value with automated content chaptering, appealing images and topic labelling
- Enable better and more valuable ad placements in line with the content displayed

## EPG Correction
- manually detecting the start and end times of your TV programs, ad breaks and shorter video segments!
- redefine the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) correction, content navigation and TV advertising using state-of-the-art AI and Machine Learning technologies.
- By identifying the exact start and end times of ad breaks in video content, Ad Break Distillery enables ad skipping, insertion or replacement in the replay and catchup environment.
- With Chapter Markers viewers can easily navigate through video content to the parts they are interested in, which leads to a higher user engagement and satisfaction.
- EPG Correction™ ensures seamless and VoD-like experiences for catch-up and replay by fully automated and real-time correction of the difference between the scheduled and the actual air times of TV programs.
- Media Distillery’s award-winning Deep Content UnderstandingTM technology can analyze video content to determine relevant topics, events or specific time markers, all in real-time and cloud-based. NOS implemented Media Distillery’s product EPG Correction Distillery™ on their 70 most popular TV channels, to provide automatic adjustments to update the actual start time of television programmes as they are broadcast, so consumers can enjoy their favorite video content instantly.
- NOS (NOS is the biggest communications and entertainment group in Portugal.) is also using the automatically generated correct time markers to insert pre-roll advertisements in their replay platform. This results in a natural transition from the content to the ad-block for the consumer, while the inserted ads create a solid revenue stream for NOS.

## Image Distillery
- image chosen to be displayed in the UI is crisp and blur-free, that the actors’/presenters’ eyes are open, and the characters’ positioning in-frame is aesthetically pleasing.
- The Images are created directly out of a broadcast signal or video asset, in a real-time and fully automated fashion. This means that even for live-programming appealing images can be provided and used to boost catch-up and replay viewing.
- Images can be generated from the entire program, or from a specified time range, to prevent inadvertently showing spoilers in the UI.
