# [[Conv]] Based Noise Reduction
- Noise is high frequency component, suppress via low-pass filters
- Ideal low-pass filter
- multiply with box filter in frequency domain
- convolution with sinc in spatial domain (impractical: infinite extent)

- Spatially narrow (wide) filter has wide (narrow) spectrum and low (high) smoothing effect
