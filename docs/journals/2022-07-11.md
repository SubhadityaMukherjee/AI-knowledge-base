- **06:13** I found a nice blog of quite a few things [colah](https://colah.github.io/)
	- [[Connectome]]
	- This is really interesting :o
		- [[Interpretability vs Neuroscience]]
			- **06:17** HOLY. I found something REALLY INTERESTING. [[Neural Circuits]]
		- In fact, I think it ties in to my thesis ideas as well :O What are the odds??
		- Okay wait. After Karpathy and Jeremy Howard, this researcher is another crazy nut. Maybe I have a new hero?? Christopher Olah is his name. All bow.
- **06:51** [Interpretability vs Neuroscience](../Interpretability%20vs%20Neuroscience.md)
- I know this should be an AI knowledge base but I think ill just use it as a general one. Who knows where connections come from right?
- [[Micromarriage]]
- [[Research Intimacy]]
- [[Research Debt]] This is so true. I guess thats a huge problem..
- This person is literally doing what I want to look into. Guess it will directly influence my thesis
