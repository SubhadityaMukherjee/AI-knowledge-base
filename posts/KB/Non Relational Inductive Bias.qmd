# Non [Relational Inductive Bias](Relational%20Inductive%20Bias.qmd)
- [Activation Functions](Activation%20Functions.qmd)
	- allow the model to capture the non-linearity hidden in the data
- [Dropout](Dropout.qmd)
	- helps the network avoid memorizing the data by forcing random subsets of the network to each learn the data pattern. As a result, the obtained model, in the end, is able to generalize better
- [Weight Decay](Weight%20Decay)
	- puts constraints on the modelâ€™s weights
- [Batch Normalization](Batch%20Normalization.qmd) , [Layer Normalization](Layer%20Normalization.qmd) , [Instance Normalization](Instance%20Normalization)
	- Reduces [Covariate Shift](Covariate%20Shift)
- [Augmentation](Augmentation.qmd)
- [Optimizers](Optimizers.qmd)
