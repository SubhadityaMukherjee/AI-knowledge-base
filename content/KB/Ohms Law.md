# Ohms Law
 - Potential difference = current x [Resistance](Resistance.md)
 - $$V= IR$$
 - Ohm's Law applied to the full circuit: Electromotive [Force](Force.md) = current x (sum of the circuit [Resistance](Resistance.md) and the internal [Resistance](Resistance.md) of the cell)
 - $$EMF = I(R+r)$$
