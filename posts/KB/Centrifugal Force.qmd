# Centrifugal [Force](Force.qmd)
- When a body rotates about an axis other than one at it's center of mass, it exerts an outward radial [force](Force.qmd) called centrifugal [force](Force.qmd) upon the axis, which restrains it from moving in a straight tangential line. To offset this [force](Force.qmd), the robot must exert an opposing torque at the joint of rotation.
