# SmoothMix
- mask-based approach
- matching closely with the [[Cutout]] and [[CutMix]] techniques
- the mask has soft edges with gradually decreasing intensity
- the mixing strategy is the same
- The augmented image has mixed pixel values depending on the strength of the mask
- $$\lambda= \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{W}\Sigma_{j=1}^{H}G_{ij}}{WH}$$
- Gij is the pixel value of mask G, H is height, and W is width
- xnew = G.xa + (1 − G).xb
- ynew = λ.ya + (1 − λ).yb
