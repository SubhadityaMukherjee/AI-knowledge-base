# Norms as a Basis for Governing Sociotechnical Systems


- Munindar P. Singh
- framework that uses social norms to govern autonomous entities' (e.g., AI agents' or human beings') behaviours
- inherently distributed rather than relying on a central authority
- Individuals maintain their autonomy through executing their own decision policies, but are subjected to social norms defined by the collective through roles
- Social norms are defined through a template containing codified commitment, authorization, prohibition, sanction and power
