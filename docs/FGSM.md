# FGSM
- FGSM is a method of generating noise in the direction of the cost function gradient concerning the data
- Given original input image x, label y, model parameter Î¸, and loss J.  
- $$adv_{x}= x+ \epsilon \ast sign(\nabla_{x}(J(\theta, x, y)))$$
- this gives us the perturbations

>   - Once the training step is completed, the stored models are loaded and used to generate perturbations from the test set using [[FGSM]].
