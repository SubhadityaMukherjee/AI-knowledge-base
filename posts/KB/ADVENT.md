 - ADVENT is a flexible technique for bridging the gap between two different domains through [[Entropy.md|entropy]] minimization
- models trained only on source domain tend to produce over-confident, i.e., low-[[Entropy.md|entropy]], predictions on source-like images and under-confident, i.e., high-[[Entropy.md|entropy]], predictions on target-like ones
- Consequently by minimizing the [[Entropy.md|entropy]] on the target domain, we make the feature distributions from the two domains more similar.
- More annotated data has been shown to always improve performance of DNNs
- Here we are working on Unsupervised DA (UDA), which is a more challenging task where we have access to labeled source samples and only unlabeled target samples. We use as source, data generated by a simulator or video game engine, while for target we consider real-data from car-mounted cameras.
- The main approaches for UDA include discrepancy minimization between source and target feature distributions usually achieved via adversarial training [[https://valeoai.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/advent-domain-adaptation.html#ganin2015unsupervised]], [[https://valeoai.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/advent-domain-adaptation.html#tzeng2017adversarial]], self-training with pseudo-labels [[https://valeoai.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/advent-domain-adaptation.html#zou2018unsupervised]] and generative approaches [[https://valeoai.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/advent-domain-adaptation.html#hoffman2018cycada]], [[https://valeoai.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/advent-domain-adaptation.html#wu2018dcan]].
- We present our two proposed approaches for [[Entropy.md|entropy]] minimization using (i) an unsupervised [[Entropy.md|entropy]] [[loss.md|loss]] and (ii) adversarial training. To build our models, we start from existing semantic segmentation frameworks and add an additional network branch used for domain adaptation.
