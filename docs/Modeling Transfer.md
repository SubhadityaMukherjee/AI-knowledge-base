# Modeling Transfer
```toc
```

- given levels of mastery on a set of knowledge components, predict the performance on a new problem (Singley & Anderson, 1989).
- For instance, suppose a student has mastered 15 of the 20 knowledge components required to do a task.
- This predicts the student's behavior on the taskâ€”where the student will ask for help, how long it will take to do the task, which errors occur, etc
- However, these predictions can be inaccurate if the assumed knowledge components are not accurate reflections of how the student actually understands the task domain
