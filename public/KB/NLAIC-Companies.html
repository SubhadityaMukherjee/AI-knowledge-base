<p>Open Sollicitatie - AI</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. While looking at your website, I found quite a lot of awesome projects (like the medical object recognition one) that made me quite interested in working at Axveco. I am currently looking for an AI role in the NL and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles with you.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI, Computer vision and Data Analytics. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am also quite familiar with the ins and outs of Deep Learning, NLP and image processing. Along with my technical knowledge, I enjoy helping clients define their vision and guiding them towards it. These are all tasks that you do, and so I think that I might be a good fit at Axveco.</p>
<p>While I am not sure what kind of roles exist at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. I am quite interested in working as part of a high performance team and the possibility of defining my own roles as well as growing my skills seems like a nice cherry on top as well. I’ve attached my resume to this email as well.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply,</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. While looking at your website, I found out about the Metis platform and some of the work your team is doing on Edge AI. Being a computer vision developer myself, I am obviously very interested in working at Axelera. I am currently looking for an AI role in the NL and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles with you.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI, Computer vision and Data Analytics. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am also quite familiar with the ins and outs of Deep Learning with a specialisation in Computer Vision. Along with my technical knowledge, what is more important is that I want to be part of your mission to democratise edge AI. I believe that this technology can lead to a lot of innovations in many fields, but without the right people, we will not be able to make AI for a green, fair and safe world. These are all tasks that you do, and so I think that I might be a good fit at Axelera.</p>

<p>Hello Jan!</p>
<p>This is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. While looking at your website, I found quite a lot of awesome projects (FoodFriend and VARUS were my favourites) that made me very interested in working at the Health domain at Almende.

<p>Hello Lennert!</p>
<p>This is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge.

<p>Hello Johan!</p>
<p>Hope you are well.</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I heard about Neolook from one of my friends (she met you at a Hattrick event at the RUG) and found the premise very interesting. She mentioned that you also have ML/DL pipelines that you wanted to implement and research, which is why I thought I would drop you an email. I am currently looking for an AI position in the NL and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles with you.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am quite familiar with DL libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow along with implementing multi-modal models. Along with that, I am good at explaining concepts at a high level and have commercial experience in deploying ML applications. </p>
<p>I am quite interested in applying AI in healthcare, and when I saw that Neolook might give me a chance to do just that, I had to apply. While at the moment I have a lot to learn about neonatal healthcare, I am willing to do that. I am not queasy about walking through wards, and am comfortable with working alone and in teams as well.</p>
<p>While I am not sure what kind of roles exist at Neolook at the moment, I am open to any AI-related positions. I’ve attached my resume to this email as well. It would be awesome to have a chat with you Johan, I hope you give me a chance!</p>

<p>Hello Dan!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I am quite interested in the AI role you just posted, and would love to talk to you and see if I could be a good fit for it.</p>

<p>Hello Dan! </p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found this position on LinkedIn and the phrase “Architects of Change” piqued my interest. I’ve heard about BlueDolphin before, and imagine my surprise when I saw that you also wanted to implement AI algorithms as well! I am currently looking for an AI role in the NL and I would love to be the one to start the ML department at ValueBlue.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI and Data Analytics. I am proficient in setting up and tuning open source models across all levels. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am quite familiar with AI libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow along with MLOps tools. I have worked quite extensively with Neptune, Tensorboard and Docker for many years as well. </p>
<p>BlueDolphin has been around for a while and I’m sure there is a lot of interesting data that was collected/obtained from public domains. This makes it all the more challenging and I am all for that.</p>
<p>I am quite passionate about both the technical and human sides of AI. Being a new department working on a lot of cross functional teams requires this mentality, and I think that I do bring this and more to the table. </p>
<p>I hope you give me a chance!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about 3DUniversum from Dr.Sezer when I met him at an event last week. The work your team does is very much in line with my interests and experience and as I am currently looking for an AI position in the NL, I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at 3DUniversum. </p>
<p>I asked him if there were open roles, and he told me that the team was expanding and while most of your group is from UvA, I could give it a shot too.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of Computer Vision and AI. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am familiar with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow and am proficient in Python as well. I have worked with Synthetic media creation, Efficient Deep Learning, Mobile/Edge AI as well as 3D Segmentation and Detection. </p>
<p>Dr.Sezer told me quite a bit about projects like Deep Therapy, WeScan and FairFake and it somehow seemed like 3DUniversum would be the perfect place for me to go next. I do think that I bring something different to the table in the domains that your team works in, and I hope you give me a chance.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Birds.ai from the NLAIC website and found some of the projects your team has done (like the CV-based solar panel inspection project).  The work your team does is very much in line with my interests and experience, and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at Birds.ai.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of Computer Vision and Data Analytics. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. I am familiar with deep learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I have worked with drone image segmentation, vision-based analysis for parts of the manufacturing pipeline and similar projects. </p>
<p>Add in the consultancy work your team does, and somehow, it seems to be exactly what I want to do as the next step in my career. I do think that my skills fit the kind of projects Birds.ai does and that I bring something different to the table. </p>
<p>While I am not sure what kind of roles exist at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. I’ve also attached my resume to this email as a little more background if that helps. </p>

<p>Hello Onno!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Kepler Vision from the NLAIC website, and saw that your team was looking for a software engineering intern. The Night Nurse software seems like a great project to start my career with and this email is my application for this position. I hope to get to learn a lot about how to be a good part of an engineering team, while also bringing my AI experience to the table.</p>
<p>While I don’t know what criteria you have in selecting an intern, this opportunity would be the absolute best next step for me. My main interests lie in Computer Vision, especially in using AI in healthcare. And somehow, this is exactly what this internship offers to teach? It would be such a miss if I did not try my best to get in.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. But, what I now need to learn is how to work on larger scale projects such as Night Nurse. I am quite good with Python, FastAPI, and AI frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow, but am not very familiar with Terraform or Typescript. I definitely want to learn them though! And this internship would be absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>I promise to put my best foot forward given a chance. I am quite a fast learning, and have a strong base in programming and AI. I hope you give me a shot. </p>
<p>PS. I have the Zuikjaar visa as well, valid for almost a year. So no issues there either.</p>

<p>Hello Coen!</p>
<p>My name is Subhaditya, I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about GrwNxt from the NLAIC website and was intrigued by the concept of GrwNxt Modules and how they could be used for reliably, combining Deep learning and plant science. I can imagine just how useful and scalable the technology would be, especially combined with AI and computer vision. The work your team does is very much in line with my interests and experience, and I would love to discuss the possibility of any such roles at GrwNxt.</p>
<p>My experience is a combination of AI and Computer Vision, which is something I see that your team works on as well. Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI projects to life. Now that I have a masters in AI, I’m trying to find places I can contribute the most to, and I think GrwNxt fits quite well to that. From the presentation on your website, I see that the modules would use a lot of advanced data analytics combined with computer vision, which is what I am the most familiar with. I am proficient at using Deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch and Tensorflow and am comfortable with all stages of the AI pipeline. Since my main focus has always been Computer vision, I can help your team implement the advanced data analysis pipelines faster as well. </p>
<p>This project really interests me and while I am not sure what kind of roles you have at the moment, I am open to any AI/Data Science related position. Being able to contribute to the sustainable food revolution is such a good cause, and I would love to be a part of it.</p>
<p>I’ve also attached my resume to this email as a little more background if that helps. If you are hiring or will be soon, I would love to have a chat!</p>
