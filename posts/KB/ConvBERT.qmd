# ConvBERT
- Convolutional BERT (ConvBERT) improves the original [BERT](BERT.qmd) by replacing some [Multi Head Attention](Multi%20Head%20Attention.qmd) [Self Attention](Self%20Attention.qmd) segments with cheaper and naturally local operations, so-called [span-based dynamic convolutions](span-based%20dynamic%20convolutions). These are integrated into the self-[attention](Attention.qmd) mechanism to form a mixed [attention](Attention.qmd) mechanism, allowing Multi-headed Self-[attention](Attention.qmd) to capture global patterns; the Convolutions focus more on the local patterns, which are otherwise captured anyway. In other words, they reduce the computational intensity of training BERT.
