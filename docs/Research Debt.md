# Research Debt
- [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)
- Achieving a research-level understanding of most topics is like climbing a mountain.
- Aspiring researchers must struggle to understand vast bodies of work that came before them, to learn techniques, and to gain intuition
- Upon reaching the top, the new researcher begins doing novel work, throwing new stones onto the top of the mountain and making it a little taller for whoever comes next.
- People expect the climb to be hard
- It reflects the tremendous progress and cumulative effort that’s gone into mathematics
- The climb is seen as an intellectual pilgrimage, the labor a rite of passage
- But the climb could be massively easier
- It’s entirely possible to build paths and staircases into these mountains.
- That is, really outstanding tutorials, reviews, textbooks, and so on.
- technical debt
- institutional debt
