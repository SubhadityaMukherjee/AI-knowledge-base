# Adrenaline
- Also called epinephrine, this hormone is secreted by the [adrenal glands](Adrenal%20Glands.md) in response to stress and other challenges to the body. The release of adrenaline causes a number of changes throughout the body, including the metabolism of carbohydrates to supply the bodyâ€™s energy demands and increased arousal or alertness.
