# Chebyshev Distance
- $$D(x,y) = max_{i}(|x_{i}-y_{i}|)$$
- greatest of difference between two vectors along any coordinate dimension
- simply the maximum distance along one axis.
- Chessboard distance since the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square to another is equal to Chebyshev distance
- can be used to extract the minimum number of moves needed to go from one square to another
- warehouse logistics as it closely resembles the time an overhead crane takes to move an object
