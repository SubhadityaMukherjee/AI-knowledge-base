# Singularity
- A configuration where two joints of the robot arm become co-axial (aligned along a common axis). In a singular configuration, smooth path following is normally impossible and the robot may lose control. The term originates from the behavior of the Jacobian matrix, which becomes singular (i.e., has no inverse) in these configurations.
