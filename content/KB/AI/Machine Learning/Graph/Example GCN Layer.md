## Example GCN Layer

- this is equivariant, can cope with any number of neighbors, uses the graph srtucture to provide a [[Relational Inductive Bias]] and parameter sharing 

### Example : Graph Classification
- Network to classify molecules as harmless or toxic
- [[Adjacency matrix]] - $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$$
- Node embedding matrix - $$X \in \mathbb{R}^{118 \times N}$$
	- 118 elements of the periodic table
	- vectors of length 118 where every position is zero except for the position corresponding to the relevant element, which is set to one
