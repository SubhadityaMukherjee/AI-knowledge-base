# The Reward Experiment
```toc
```
- “Why aren’t we always prepared?”  
	- Is it a matter of motivation?  
	- Reward bocks: flat(ter) preparation curves?
- Reward blocks: more memory effects
	- [[Cognition Hazard Rates]]
- Reward blocks: less memory effects
	- [[Cognitive fMTP]]

- Fanning
	- smaller if reward
	- less effects of previous trial

## Findings
- The effects of reward and brightness on preparation
	- Additive effects : neither affects the slope
	- even when motivated, preparation depends on FP
	- Stimulus visibility does not interact with preparation
		- Maybe not a visual attention process

- Reward has more effects when targets are highly visible
	- Interaction : Reward * Brightness
	- ![[Pasted image 20221205143452.png]]
- Effects on accuracy
	- Reward blocks→ higher accuracy  
	 - High visibility → higher accuracy  
	 - More errors with longer foreperiod….  
		- …But only when rewarded/motivated  
		- …And mainly when visibility low

- Effects on memory from past trials
	- Past trial effects $$fp \ast fp(n-1)$$
	- This effect (the fanning) is essentially constant across target visibility and reward  
	- If anything: a little bit larger when there is no reward.

- Effects on memory
	- Up to n-5
	- When there is reward, there is slightly ‘faster forgetting’
	- Faster forgetting when rewarded slightly
