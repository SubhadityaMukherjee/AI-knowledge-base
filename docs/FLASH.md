- [Transformer Quality in Linear Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10447)
- weaknesses in handling long sequences
- FLASH
- performant layer (gated linear unit) and by combining it with an accelerator-efficient approximation strategy ([[Mixed chunk attention|mixed chunk attention]])
- [[GAU]]
- [[Mixed chunk attention]]
- outperforms three baselines: vanilla [[Transformer]], Performer and Combiner in terms of quality and efficiency
