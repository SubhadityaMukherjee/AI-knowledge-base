# Receptive Field
- Not for Dense, only local connected [layers](Layers.qmd) like [Conv](Conv.qmd), [Pooling](Pooling.qmd)
- A neuron's receptive field is the patch of the total field of view that a single neuron has access to
- Almost a logarithmic relationship between classification accuracy and receptive field size
	- Large fields are almost necessary for high level recognition tasks, but with diminishing rewards
- $$r(i-1) = s_{i}\times r_{i} + (k_{i}-s_{i})$$

- Recursive
	- $$r_{0} = \Sigma^{L}_{i=1}((k_{i}-1)\Pi_{j=1}^{l-1}s_{j})+1$$
- How to increase receptive field
	- Add more [Conv](Conv.qmd)
	- Add [pooling](Pooling.qmd) or higher stride
	- [Causal Dilated Conv](Causal%20Dilated%20Conv.qmd)
	- [Depthwise Separable](Depthwise%20Separable.qmd)
