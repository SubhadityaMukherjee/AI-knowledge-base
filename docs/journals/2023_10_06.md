- Other things I want to do today
	- Do a random bit of research on "standing desks"
	- Make a human resume and send it to a few people
	- Learn a bit more about Diffusion models
	- Draw dragons

- **12:39** I wrote around 1.8k words and now I am very hungry. I will go back home to get some lunch and then maybe finish the rest of the article. And then move on to other things on my list.
- **02:39** Finished the article. Watched a bunch of YT and had lunch. Will post it now on medium.
- **02:48** Posted it, maybe I will take a shower and then get to making a human resume.
- **05:56** That took a while. Done for now, gotta modify it based on the company ofc. Now I just need to start sending them out to people lol. Ouch. This is hard work.
	- Also need to call parents now and then perhaps I will try to send it to atleast one person.
