# Minimal Semantic Commitment


- (Frazier et al., 1999)
- The MSC hypothesis distinguishes between two types of mental representations the processor might entertain upon encountering an underdetermined semantic constituent: if the representation is ambiguous, the processor will commit to just one interpretation and later revise it if necessary, but if the representation is vague, the processor refrains from committing to an interpretation, leaving some features underdetermined until further information is made available.
