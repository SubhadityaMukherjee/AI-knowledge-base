# Eneco Motivation Letter - Subhaditya


As I write this motivation letter, the temperatures in NL have hit yet another record for the hottest September ever. One of the biggest reasons for this is global warming, and carbon emissions are a massive component. Eneco's mission to be carbon neutral and help customers shift towards sustainable energy sources greatly resonates with me, so I am applying for this position as a Data Scientist.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. In my previous internship at KPMG, I built 10+ dashboards using PowerBI for a project with the Abu Dhabi government. In other internships, I have made several analytics pipelines and machine learning implementations. 

In any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing solutions that have a positive impact, and I can contribute quite a bit to any team I get the chance to work with. If there is anything I do not know, I am also ready to develop those skills quickly.
