# Critical Points
- sink (attracting node): all vectors converge  
- source (repelling node): all vectors diverge  
- saddle point: slopes are zero in orthogonal directions, no extremum â€¢ center point: embedded by (circular) flow around  
- attracting focus: flow is attracted in a spiral pattern
- repelling focus, where the flow is repelled in a spiral pattern
