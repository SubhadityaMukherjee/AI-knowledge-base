# Localist Units
- In a localist representation, a localist unit (neuron) is most active to one meaningful category
- In Input: when we build a network and let each input unit represent a a specific word
- In Output: when we allow outputs of single unit to be interpreted
- In the hidden units: is there evidence of localist encoding developing?
