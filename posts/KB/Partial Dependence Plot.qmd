# Partial Dependence Plot


- Another approach [29] shows the marginal effect of one or two features on the prediction of learning techniques using Partial Dependence Plots
- The method gives a statement about the global relationship of a feature and whether its relation to the outcome is linear, monotonic, or more complex.
- The PDP is the average of Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) over all features
- ICE [30] points to how the prediction changes if a feature changes.
- The PDP is limited to two features.
