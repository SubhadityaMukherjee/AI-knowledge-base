# Gaussian Distortion


- Grid width and height, and magnitude are kept the same as the random distortion values of 6, 6, and 5, respectively
- The Gaussian distortion has the added parameters of applying the distortion based on the 2D normal distribution
- normal distortion is applied to each grid point on a circular surface (corner="bell") and with default values for the mean and standard deviation ($\mu_{x}$ = $\mu_{y}$ = 0.5,$\sigma_{x}$ = $\sigma_{y}$ = 0.05)
- $$p(x,y) = exp\{-(\frac{(x-\mu_{x})^{2}}{\sigma_{x}} + \frac{(x-\mu_{y})^{2}}{\sigma_{y}}))\}$$
