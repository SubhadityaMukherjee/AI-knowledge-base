## LM Lab 3

### Background
- Fraiser
- Minimal Semantic Commitment (MSC) hypothesis
- Given ambiguous representations, the MSC hypothesis predicts that the processor will commit to one interpretation
- In an experiment designed to evaluate these hypotheses with respect to the representation of distributivity, participants' eye movements were recorded as they read sentences containing distributive or collective predicates that were either disambiguated by a preceding adverb or left locally ambiguous by delaying the disambiguating adverb until the end of the predicate
- The results suggested that a semantic commitment is made in locally indeterminate cases as evidenced by a significant interaction of ambiguity and distributivity in first pass times, total times, and regressions
- Hence we argue that the distributive/collective distinction is treated as a matter of ambiguity rather than as one of vagueness
- In the absence of evidence for a distributive reading, the processor commits itself to a collective reading sometime during the processing of the predicate (before the disambiguation in our late disambiguation examples)
- By the MSC hypothesis, this will predict that a premature decision, one made early on the basis of little information, should not occur during immediate processing
- The point is that no commitment will be made in the absence of supporting evidence
- ) By contrast, given the MSC hypothesis, the notion that a string is grammatically ambiguous predicts that the processor encounters a choice point on initial analysis, adopting one representation rather than another
- In our experiment we only examined collective/distributive subjects in single clause sentences
- The ambiguity hypothesis predicts an interaction
- the vagueness hypothesis doesn't
- T
- In order to test for possible pragmatic biases in the predicate, participants were asked to rate the 'naturalness' of the locally ambiguous collective or distributive predicates contained in the experimental sentences
- when the actual conjoined NP subject in the experimental materials was replaced by a pronominal subject
- Thirtytwo students native English speakers
- Each version of the questionnaire contained eight sentences in which the locally ambiguous predicate was subsequently disambiguated towards a distributive interpretation using each and eight sentences in which the predicate was subsequently disambiguated towards a collective interpretation using together
- 7point scale
- They were told that there were no right or wrong answers and that we were only interested in their opinions of the naturalness of the sentences
- another rating study was conducted using truncated versions of the locally ambiguous items such that each item ended after the word each or together
- examined first pass reading times, total reading times, and the pattern of regressions for different regions of the target sentences
- Sixty undergraduate students bite bar
- ## Experiment
- dealt with where readers look during reading and that they should read each sentence for comprehension
- Sixteen experimental sentences were embedded in 107 filler sentences
- Each sentence appeared in one of four versions, as in (7) above: in two versions (a and c), the predicate received a distributive interpretation, and in the other two (b and d) the predicate received a collective interpretation
- region
- he first region consisted of the words preceding the predicate (a conjoined NP)
- the second region consisted of the predicate itself
- the third region comprised the next three words, or next two words if the third word was the last word in the sentence
- and the fourth region was the remainder of the sentence
- The fourth region was created solely so that results from the third region would be free of sentence wrapup effects
- In the first region, none of the effects were significant
- In the second region, there was an effect of ambiguity, wherein the locally ambiguous versions were read faster than unambiguous versions, possibly due to a preference for adverbs to appear in verbphrase final position
- he raw reading times analyses and analyses of residuals were consistent in
- indicating that the interaction did not approach significance
- In the third region, the different versions of any given sentence were once again identical
- Here, locally ambiguous versions were read somewhat slower overall than unambiguous versions
- However, this difference failed to approach significance in the subjects analysis (F1(1,59) = 1
- 91, P � 0
- 16) and was only marginally significant by items
- Crucially, each of these marginally significant main effects was qualified by a highly robust interaction between ambiguity and predicate type, suggesting that distributive predicates were read more slowly than collective predicates in the locally ambiguous versions
- Pairwise comparisons confirmed that while distributives were read more slowly in the ambiguous versions (F1(1,59) = 10
- 84, P � 0
- 01
- F2(1,14) =20
- 48, P � 0
- 001), there was no reliable predicate effect in the unambiguous versions
- The results of this analysis for first pass times revealed striking differences between ambiguous and unambiguous forms
- In the residuals analyses, distributives (each) were read slower than collectives (together) in both ambiguous and unambiguous forms
- However, the effect was much larger in ambiguous forms than unambiguous forms (223 ms vs
- 43 ms), and while in ambiguous forms the effect was significan
- Distributives were significantly faster than collectives in unambiguous forms (means: 844 ms vs
- 925 ms
- F1(1,59) = 4
- 72, P � 0
- 05, F2 (1,14) = 10
- 39, P � 0
- 01), but significantly slower than collectives in ambiguous forms
- n the third region, where the different versions were again identical, there was a main effect of ambiguity, with ambiguous versions being read slower overall than unambiguous versions
- There was also a robust predicate effect (F1(1,59) = 9
- 53, P � 0
- 01
- F2(1,14) = 10
- 88, P � 0
- 01), which indicated that distributives were read more slowly overall
- In the second region, there were no significant differences across conditions in the percentages of trials on which regressions occurred out of the region (Fs � 1)
- In the third region, the mean percentage of trials on which regressions occurred out of the region was 19-, 8-, 4- and 4- for the ambiguousdistributive, ambiguouscollective, unambiguousdistributive, and unambiguouscollective conditions, respectively
- There were significantly more trials involving regressions out of the third region in the ambiguous than the unambiguous versions
- The predictions of the vagueness hypothesis were clearly disconfirmed
- Given the MSC hypothesis, the vagueness hypothesis predicts no interaction between ambiguity and sentence form: in both the ambiguous distributive (7a) and the unambiguous distributive (7c) the processor should postulate a distributive operator when each is encountered
- ounter to this prediction, the ambiguous distributive form was substantially more difficult to understand than the other sentence forms
- This may be seen in the significant interaction of ambiguity and sentence form in first pass and total times in region three, as well as in the regressions out of region three and regressions into region two
- Readers clearly exhibited a preference for the collective reading of the ambiguous portion of the sentences in our experiment
- These results make it difficult to maintain the assumptions needed to salvage the vagueness hypothesis
- Instead, given the MSC hypothesis, they support the assumption that the correct grammatical account of collective/distributive differences treats the distinction as one of ambiguity rather than as one of vagueness, at least in cases like those tested, where subjectpredicate relations are involved
- We turn now to alternative interpretations of our results
- The question is whether the results can be attributed directly to the complexity of the distributive reading
- We think not
- It may be true that distributive readings, even unambiguous ones, are slightly more complex than collective readings
- This suggests that readers may not simply add information to the current representation of these locally ambiguous forms when each is encountered
- Similarly the results are difficult to reconcile with a parallel processing view unless the processor has computed both a collective and a distributive representation and then abandoned the distributive representation before each is encountered

## Boylan
- Frazier et al. (1999) used eyetracking reading times to compare processing loads of sentences that were explicitly distributive (involving the adverb each), explicitly collective (involving the adverb together), and locally indeterminate at the predicate.
- Having found evidence for increased processing load associated with distributive sentences, they concluded that the processor initially pursues a collective reading, and thus the distributive / collective distinction was one of ambiguity and not vagueness.
- However, an increased processing load for the distributive reading might be expected regardless of whether the underlying representation is vague or ambiguous
- eye movements of listeners were recorded to investigate the representation of collective vs. distributive interpretations of plural subjects in light of the Minimal Semantic Commitment (MSC) hypothesis
- Rather than relying on processing times to infer representational commitments, we employed the visual world paradigm to track which representations subjects considered over the course of hearing a sentence
- In a targeted analysis of disambiguator effects in each time window, we found significant differences between together and each sentences and the null and each sentences after the predicate onset but not before
- This provides evidence that the listener has committed to the collective interpretation in the absence of disambiguating information.
- This is consistent with a theory that treats the collective / distributive distinction as ambiguous rather than vague.
- The results also indicate that this processing commitment is essentially immediate; i.e., as soon as listeners begin hearing the ambiguous predicate, they show a preference for the collective interpretation.
- The Self Organization of Explicit Attitudes
- implicit biases beyond cognitive control and subjective awareness, yet mental processing may culminate in an explicit attitude that feels personally endorsed and corroborates voluntary intentions
- While our participants reported their explicit (like vs. dislike) attitudes toward White versus Black people by moving a cursor to a ''like'' or ''dislike'' response box, we recorded streaming xand ycoordinates from their handmovement trajectories
- participants' handmovement paths exhibited greater curvature toward the ''dislike'' response when they reported positive explicit attitudes toward Black people than when they reported positive explicit attitudes toward White people
- these trajectories were characterized by movement disorder and competitive velocity profiles that were predicted under the assumption that the deliberate attitudes emerged from continuous interactions between multiple simultaneously conflicting constraints.
- 2 experiments
- For example, an implicit attitude toward a stimulus can be unintentionally activated by the mere presence of that stimulus.
- Given that many people demonstrate spontaneous initial biases toward traditionally stigmatized groups, how do they overcome these biases to explicitly report positive attitudes toward the same groups?
- In early moments of processing, distributed representations are partially consistent with multiple interpretations because of their proximity to multiple neural population codes.
- However, a continuous accrual of information causes the distributed pattern to dynamically ''sharpen'' into a confident (selected) interpretation, forcing other, partially activated, competing alternative representations, decisions, or actions to gradually die out.
- The latter attitude will eventually activate other subsystems, such as language and memory, thus making the attitude seem explicit
- What makes the first attitude implicit is not necessarily that it was generated in a different subsystem, but simply that it did not hold sway long enough to activate those language and memory subsystems.
- The unfolding cognitive dynamics may be revealed in continuous motor output
- Because mental processing is [[recurrent]], motor representations begin specifying movement parameters probabilistically, rather than waiting for a perfectly completed cognitive command
- If the phrase ''Black people'' evokes elevated dynamic competition between simultaneously active ''like'' and ''dislike'' representations, movement trajectories for ''Black people'' should exhibit evidence of nonlinear dynamics in their velocity profiles, as well as increased spatial disorder in the curviness of the trajectories.
- Streaming xand ycoordinates of mousecursor movements were recorded from 68 Cornell University undergraduates (43 female and 25 male) as they performed a simple explicitattitude task.
- 2 s for participants to view the evaluative response options
- Participants then clicked on a small box at the bottom of the screen to reveal a stimulus word or phrase and dragged the mouse toward their selected evaluative response to that stimulus
- Responses to the two stimulus repetitions were averaged together to yield a single measurement for each participant for all statistical analyses.
- Compared with the trajectories for ''White people,'' the trajectories for ''Black people'' curved significantly more toward the ''dislike'' response option observed differential motor curvatures could have been generated by a stagebased sequence of decisional commands, rather than by continuous motor attraction to the ''dislike'' response.
- To accommodate the empirical mean trajectory, which initially moved upward rather than actually toward ''dislike,'' such an account would need to predict a bimodal distribution of curvatures that included some trajectories that were very curved and others that were not curved.
- However, the distribution of trajectory curvatures shows no evidence of bimodality The standard cutoff for inferring bimodality in a distribution is b > 0.55
- as the more active alternative begins to win the competition, this lateral inhibition is gradually lifted, thus increasing velocity later in processing to produce greater acceleration
- Moreover, this particular dynamic pattern (reduced early velocity and greater later acceleration) should lead to greater peak velocity, if jerk is minimized as the system achieves equivalent integral under the curve (where the integral represents net change in activation or location)
- The ''Black people'' trajectories had significantly greater deviation from the sigmoidal fit
- indicated disorderly variation around the x dimension in those trajectories.
- our claim is that multiple, partially active mental representations compete for the privilege of driving evaluative responses, imposing a set of response options that are not particularly competitive should change the motor dynamics
- Seventyone Cornell University undergraduates (37 female and 34 male) were asked to classify stimuli as something they liked (''like'') or disliked (''dislike'')
- The crucial stimuli in this experiment were ''African Americans'' and ''Caucasians. Results
- The trajectories for ''African Americans'' curved significantly more toward the ''dislike'' response than the trajectories for ''Caucasians,
- The motor trajectories evolved over time in accordance with the competitive velocity predictions, as reported in Experiment
- The ''African Americans'' trajectories, compared with the ''Caucasians'' trajectories, had significantly greater maximum xcoordinate acceleration
- Moreover, as we found for ''Black people'' trajectories in Experiment 1, the ''African Americans'' trajectories exhibited greater spatial disorder than the ''Caucasians'' trajectories, even after moving toward the ''like'' response, as indicated by significantly greater mean deviation from the sigmoidal
- Rather, the results suggest that a dynamic competition process may be what allows a single explicit attitude choice to emerge from multiple, potentially conflicting evaluative influences (e.g., Busemeyer & Townsend, 1993; Usher & McClelland, 2003)
- the mind may host a continuously evolving blend of (implicit) evaluative decisions from which the eventual (explicit) behavioral choice emerges.

## Tracking the Continuity of Language Comprehension Computer Mouse Trajectories Suggest Parallel Syntactic Processing - FARMER
- Although several theories of online syntactic processing assume the parallel activation of multiple syntactic representations, evidence supporting simultaneous activation has been inconclusive
- continuous and nonballistic properties of computer mouse movements are exploited
- procure evidence regarding parallel versus serial processing
- Participants heard structurally ambiguous sentences while viewing scenes with properties either supporting or not supporting the difficult modifier interpretation
- The curvatures of the elicited trajectories revealed both an effect of visual context and graded competition between simultaneously active syntactic representations
- Sentences such as, "The adolescent hurried through the door tripped," are difficult to process because, at least temporarily, multiple possible structural representations exist
- gardenpath effect
- When ambiguous sentences like 1a are heard in the presence of visual scenes where only one possible referent is present (an apple already on a towel), along with an incorrect destination (an empty towel), and a correct destination (a box), as in the top portion of Fig. 1, about 50- of the time participants fixate the incorrect destination after hearing the first PP.
- After the second disambiguating PP is heard, eye movements tend to be redirected to the correct referent and then to the correct destination
- This gardenpath effect can, however, be modulated by contextual information contained within the visual scene
- it seems that when two possible referents are present, an expectation is created that they will be discriminated amongst, thus forcing a modifier interpretation of the ambiguous PP
- However, because saccadic eye movements are generally ballistic, they either send the eyes to fixate an object associated with a gardenpath interpretation or they do not.
- The evidence from this paradigm, therefore, is also consistent with the Unrestricted Race model, where the various constraints are combined immediately, but on any given trial only one syntactic representation is initially pursued
- In the following experiment, we examined the dynamics of hand movement in the same sentence comprehension scenario with the goal of determining whether the nonballistic, continuous nature of computer mouse trajectories can serve to tease apart these two remaining theoretical accounts.
- In addition, whereas selfpaced reading affords 2 to 3 data points (button presses) per second, and eyemovement data allow for approximately 3 to 4 data points (saccades) per second, "mouse tracking" yields somewhere between 30 and 60 data points per second, depending on the sampling rate of the software used.
- The context and gardenpath effects reported in the visual world paradigm are highly replicable when tracking eye movements
- ## Expected Prediction
- 1) Averaged trajectories recorded in response to ambiguous sentences in the onereferent context should show significantly more curvature toward the incorrect destination than the averaged trajectories elicited by unambiguous sentences—a pattern corresponding to the gardenpath effect. 2)
- The curvature of averaged trajectories in the two referent condition should not differ statistically between ambiguous and unambiguous sentences, thus demonstrating an influence of referential context on the gardenpath effect.
- The second purpose of this study, then, was to exploit the continuity of the mousemovement trajectories to discriminate between these two remaining theoretical accounts
- If only one representation were active at any one time, as the unrestricted race account predicts, then the trialbytrial distribution of trajectory curvatures in the ambiguoussentence condition should be either (a) bimodal—comprised of highly curved gardenpath movements and noncurved, correctinterpretation movements, or (b) uniformly in the more extreme curved range, indicating that almost every trial exhibited a gardenpath effect
- Forty righthanded, native Englishspeaking undergraduates from Cornell University participated in the study for extra credit in psychology courses
- only righthanded individuals to avoid variability associated with subtle kinematic differences in leftward and rightward movement of the left versus the right arms.
- Sixteen experimental items 102 filler sentences
- There was no significant main effect or interaction for either the x or the y coordinates (all ps were nonsignificant) indicating that, across conditions, the trajectories were initiated at approximately the same location of the display
- To determine whether any bimodality is present in the distribution of responses, we computed the area under the curve on a trialbytrial basis
- Thus, in the presence of the gardenpath effect, it seems clear that there exists more spatial attraction toward the incorrect destination for the ambiguous sentences.
- The b value for each distribution is less than .555, indicating no presence of bimodality within the distributions.
- Thus, it would seem that when only one referent was present, the incorrect destination (e.g., the towel) was partially considered relevant, until disambiguating information was processed—a trend corresponding to the gardenpath effect associated with this condition.
- The fact that most mouse trajectories began while the speech file was still being heard suggests that the effect of visual context modulating the garden path took place during early moments of processing the linguistic input, not during a second stage of syntactic reanalysis.
- The lack of bimodality in the distribution of trialbytrial trajectory curvatures suggests that the gardenpath effect so frequently associated with this manipulation is not an allornone phenomenon—that is, the activation of one structural representation does not forbid simultaneous activation of other possible representations
- Unrestricted Race Model
- The Unrestricted Race model (Traxler, Pickering, & Clifton, 1998; van Gompel, Pickering, Pearson, & Liversedge, 2005; van Gompel, Pickering, & Traxler, 2001) follows in the footsteps of constraintbased models in proposing simultaneous integration of multiple constraints from statistical, semantic, and contextual sources
- However, rather than ambiguity resolution being based on a temporally dynamic competition process, the Unrestricted Race model posits an instantaneous probabilistic selection among the weighted alternatives of an ambiguity.
- much like the syntaxfirst models, it must hypothesize a separate reanalysis mechanism that is responsible for gardenpath effects when the initial selected alternative turns out to be syntactically or semantically inappropriate.
- the Unrestricted Race model predicts that sentences with gardenpaths and sentences without gardenpaths are two separate populations of events
- In other words, in conditions where mean performance is expected to exhibit a gardenpath effect, there should exist one of two possible patterns: (a) a bimodal distribution of some substantial gardenpath responses and some nongardenpath responses, or (b) practically all trials exhibiting substantial gardenpath effect

### Abstract
- Mouse movements are not ballistic
- Mousetracking can show us curved movement trajectories can gives us more information about what causes a delay in processing
- Mouse movements have an advantage in identifying decisions at a very high resolution
- However, it cannot tell us information about what causes a slow- down in processing
- Garden Path Sentences
- Eye-tracking experiment investigating preferences for collective vs.
- distributive interpretations
- Response to Frazier et al. (1999)'s results
- Argue that Frazier et al.'s results reflect processing cost but not necessarily representational commitments.
- A second study (recall Frazier et al. ) that the collective-distributive distinction is a matter of ambiguity and not vagueness.
- 2x2 study (Picture: Collective vs. Distributive) and Sentence: (With marker ("each" or "together") or without)
- Understand what type of data you get out of a mouse tracking experiment with two
- conditions
- Use linear mixed effect models to analyze experimental results with a continuous
- dependent variable – do lmer's for Reaction Time (RT) data, Maximum Deviation (MD) data and Area under the Curve (AUC) and determine whether or not there was a significant difference between conditions.
- It was predicted that in the experimental trials, mouse movement trajectories would show evidence of competition between the categories.
- This competition would be revealed by an analysis of mouse movement trajectory divergence
- For the analysis of our results we are going to focus on three measures:
- A. Reaction Time (RT) from Start-click to response click
- B. Maximum Deviation (MD) of the response curve from an idealized response curve
- C. Area under the curve (AUC) created by the response curve extending to the idealized response curve

### Results
- Task 2
- 1 person over 3 : REMOVED
- mean RTs
- pirateplot
- Null is higher. Without marker > higher RTs. (Ambiguous)
- Collective are lower
- 1 outlier
- Task 4
- Bes model : RT_log ~ ambiguity + picture + (1 | subject)
- QQnorm is yeeted. So remove outliers over 2.5 stddev
- 7 outliers removed
- 0.02302632 - removed
- AIC : 201.0 > 289.2
- Fixed effect
- Adding in Max dev and AUC got us a better model : AIC : 312.66
- RT_log ~ ambiguity + picture + sum_AUC * sum_MD + (1 | subject)
- Moderate + core between picture and ambiguity

### EXTRAS
- 1) Do you expect the commitment towards one of the interpretations (collective or distributive) in the Unambiguous condition?
- No.
- 2) Do you expect the commitment towards one of the interpretations (collective or distributive) in the Ambiguous condition?
- Yes. Towards collective.
- 4) Is it correct to remove Incorrect responses for the analysis for this experiment?
- Since we had a small sample, we will tolerate up to 3 errors per subject.
- 5) Do you expect the responses for one condition to be faster than responses for the other? Which one?
- The results also indicate that this processing commitment is essentially immediate; i.e., as soon as listeners begin hearing the ambiguous predicate, they show a preference for the collective interpretation.
- # What comparisons make the most sense given your predictions?
- The RT/MD/AUC for NullDis have low values (low in the sense – smaller AUC, lower MD and faster RT)?
- NO/NO
- The RT/MD/AUC for NullColl have high values (high in the sense – Larger AUC, higher MD and slower RT?
- NO/NO
- The RT/MD/AUC for MarkDis have low values
