# No Bias Decay
- No [Learning Rate Decay tricks](Learning%20Rate%20Decay%20tricks.md)
- Equivalent to [Lp Regularization](Lp%20Regularization.md) L2 to all parameters to drive the values towards 0
- Only apply [Regularization](Regularization.md) to the weights
- Leave [Batch Normalization](Batch%20Normalization.md) [Layers](Layers.md) alone
- [LARS](LARS)
