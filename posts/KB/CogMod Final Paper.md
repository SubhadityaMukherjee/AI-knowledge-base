# CogMod Final Paper

- [The Reward Experiment](The%20Reward%20Experiment.md.md)
- An ACT-R model that explains at least one of these effects (well)  
- Report to justify design choices
- ‘cognitive’ interpretation, that is justifiable & plausible

## To test
- linear decrease in goal activation 

## Papers
- [Sequential effects within a short foreperiod context Evidence for the conditioning account of temporal preparation](Sequential%20effects%20within%20a%20short%20foreperiod%20context%20Evidence%20for%20the%20conditioning%20account%20of%20temporal%20preparation.md.md) : IMPORTANT
- [Traces of times past Representations of temporal intervals in memory](Traces%20of%20times%20past%20Representations%20of%20temporal%20intervals%20in%20memory.md.md) : Explain the fanning effect

- [Modeling motivation using goal competition in mental fatigue studies](Modeling%20motivation%20using%20goal%20competition%20in%20mental%20fatigue%20studies.md.md) : performance in reward vs non reward , distraction, linear decrease in goal activation

- [Implicitly learning when to be ready - From instances to categories](Implicitly%20learning%20when%20to%20be%20ready%20-%20From%20instances%20to%20categories.md.md) : fanning , maybe the graphs can also be explained by categorical association instead of just instance based
