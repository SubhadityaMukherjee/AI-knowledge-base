# Emergentism
- What seems symbolic emerges from distributed representations
	- qualitatively newand more complex structures can emerge from simpler, basic facts
	- Language structure can emerge from simply listening and producing speech
	- Structural properties of language, e.g. part-of-speech (nouns, verbs) can emerge from serial order, distributional properties and procedural memory.
