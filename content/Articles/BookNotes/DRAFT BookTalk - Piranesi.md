# BookTalk - Piranesi
```toc
```
- COMPLETE spoilers ahead. Read at your own discretion
- piranesi means trapped
- what was it about
	- house with ancient statues and sea
	- Piranesi wakes up with no real memory of who he is and just knows he loves the "house"
	- writing style reminded me of the book The Slow Regard of Silent Things by Patrick Rothfuss
- labyrinth
	- place where the lost magic of life seeped into
		- by it's seeping, it created cracks in reality, like doors
		- you could then potentially use these doors to travel to this place
		- actually pretty close to the version of the labyrinth described in Percy Jackson, by Rick Riordan
	- winding passages
	- greek, minotaur
	- statues and sculptures of things like people fishing, war and conflicts
	- rituals to enter
		- place with the time where you were in the most childlike state
		- doors would show up, each leading to a different place
	- many doors, each with it's own personality
		- at some point, there was no food or water, but he learned how to fish, make soup
		- survive by keeping warm
		- the other would initially give him some food and clothes and the like, and then after he forgot about them, the other stopped
		- spoke to the birds, seagulls, albatross
			- this was very serene
			- he believed he was a "child of the house"
- the other
	- piranesi thought he was his friend
	- of course he was the real enemy, he enslaved piranesi to explore the labyrinth and ensured that he had no memory of a life before that
	- Not entirely sure what he got out of it except a sadistic pleasure
	- was from the real world
- the ancient people
	- believed that the world was in constant communication with them
	- when they said something, the world would listen and vice versa
	- this let them do miraculous things
		- kinda like what taoism says, and the alchemist and basically so many fantasy books
- remains of other people
	- skeletons and the dead
	- piranesi used to take care of them, bring them food
	- he wanted to know who they were but he couldnt find out
		- until the end, where they turned out to be people the "other" brought inside the labyrinth who got lost
- journals
	- this seemed pretty useful IRL
	- He kept a daily journal, indexed with events and by person. Would be interesting to make something like this for my own journals
	- Before he lost his memory, he realized at some point that he was a slave, and the anger and desperation drove him to madness and he destroyed a large chunk of his journal entries
	- using this he realized that the house kept erasing his memories, and he kept supplying information to the other
- lost magic of daily life
	- towards the end he sees people IRL and "remembers" seeing their counterparts in the labyrinth.
	- An old person is a king in the labyrinth, but IRL he has "forgotten that"
- life with memory loss
	- his actual memory was lost and he "piranesi" developed a new one. When he went back to reality, he tried to find a midpoint between the old and new him.
	- His parents and friends were strangers, who knew him for his body
	- but his mind was different
- violence
	- of course the "other" and the professor tended to violence and abuse
	- Their motives beyond that were unclear
- rescue
	- police woman
		- the other wanted to kill her, and kept telling piranesi that she would drive him mad
		- he found messages written by her which eventually helped him reach out and find her
			- in chalk, and in scattered stone
			- he used it to learn the way around the labyrinth
	- a high tide with the oceans rushing in eventually killed the other
- Essence and learnings
	- Journals are hella important. I should index mine somehow.
	- The return to a childlike state lets you see the lost magic in things
		- Its interesting that this is what let him feel "unity" with the "house". His childlike state let him talk to the birds and hear the world
	- The notion of the world talking back to you
