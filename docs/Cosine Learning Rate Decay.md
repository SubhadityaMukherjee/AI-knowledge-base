# Cosine Learning Rate Decay
- Instead of [Learning Rate Warmup](Learning%20Rate%20Warmup.md) and then decay
- $$\eta_{\mathrm{t}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\cos\left(\frac{\mathrm{t}\pi}{\mathrm{\mathrm{T}}}\right)\right)\eta$$
- Rate decreases slowly at first, then almost linear in the middle and slows down again in the end
