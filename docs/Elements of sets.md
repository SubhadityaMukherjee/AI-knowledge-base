# Elements of Sets
- The stickers we have in stocks are stars, the moons, item and a flag.
- I’ll take two moons.
- The moons in the 2nd sentences should be understood to be some of the moons mentioned in the 1st sentence.
- Notice that to understand the 2nd sentence at all requires that we use the context of the first sentence to establish that the word ‘moons’ means moon stickers.
