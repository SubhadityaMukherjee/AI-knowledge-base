# Clear Thinking
- Developing good abstractions, notations, visualizations, and so forth, is improving the user interfaces for ideas.
- This helps both with understanding ideas for the first time and with thinking clearly about them.
- Conversely, if we can’t explain an idea well, that’s often a sign that we don’t understand it as well as we could.
