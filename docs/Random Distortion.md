# Random Distortion
```toc
```

- The parameters of this distortion are given in terms of grid width, grid height, and magnitude. The granularity of the distortion is controlled by the grid width and height, representing the number of horizontal and vertical divisions to apply distortion to. Both values are chosen as 6, and the magnitude of the distortion is chosen as 5. As images are only 32Ã—32 pixels, distortion is expected to produce unrealistic examples.
