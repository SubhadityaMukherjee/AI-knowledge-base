# Orbisk
- hannah@orbisk.com : Hannah Nesmith-Beck


Growing up in Dubai and India, I've been seeing the effects of food waste almost every day. While many of us are taking steps to reduce personal food waste at the individual level, more is needed in industries. After I moved to the Netherlands, I started using the app TooGood2Go, and every time I went to any of the restaurants, they had so many bags of food to give away it was very disheartening. Orbi is a great product, from what information I could find on the website. Growing up, I could do nothing about food waste, but if my programming skills can contribute even a little to the fight, I'm definitely in.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Masters in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. From what I can gather, Orbi has an image classification algorithm at its heart. But perhaps the bigger problem is the data itself. This is a challenging problem, but tackling it even more efficiently with the proper steps should be possible. While I do have some ideas on improving the efficiency and performance of the system, I would be happy to work on any other task at hand as well. 

Above everything, having even a tiny positive impact on society is something that I am passionate about. Orbi is an excellent step forward in the fight against food waste, and I hope to get a chance to make it even more worthwhile for industries to adopt Orbi as part of their daily process.

Hello Hannah,

This is Subhaditya. I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the University of Groningen and am looking for my next big challenge. I found out about Orbisk while looking for positions that would let me use my skills for a good cause. While I am not sure what positions are open, I thought it would be great to reach out and see if I can, perhaps in some way, be part of the fight against food waste with Orbisk.

As a summary - my expertise and interest is a combination of computer vision and data analytics. That being the case, I am looking for a junior role in an AI/ML position. I have attached my resume to this email as well, just in case we can discuss a potential match.
