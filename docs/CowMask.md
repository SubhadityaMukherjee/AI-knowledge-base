# CowMask
- semi-supervised learning
- original and augmented images are brought closer during training
- CowMask suggests two types of mixing approaches 1) erasing and 2) mixing two images similar to cutmix
- The mask here is of irregular shape rather than rectangular and generated by masking or keeping a proportion of image pixels through thresholding.
- Gaussian filter is applied to remove noise before thresholding.
- Pixel values below the threshold are either erased or replaced by the pixel values of the randomly selected image at the corresponding locations.
