# Predicting Student Learning Curve
```toc
```

- (Croteau, Heffernan, & Koedinger, 2004).
- The learning curve of a [[knowledge component]] graphs the durations of its learning events (or their probability of error).
- a learning curve should be a smoothly descending power-law or exponential curve
- For instance, the first [[learning event]] for a [[knowledge component]] may take 50 seconds, because the student is constructing the [[knowledge component]] by referring to the textbook and asking the tutoring system for help. The next [[learning event]] might take only 25 seconds because the student is reconstructing the [[knowledge component]]. On the third [[learning event]], the student recalls the [[knowledge component]] after a brief struggle, so the event takes 12 seconds. The fourth event takes 6 seconds, the fifth takes 3 seconds, and so on. However, if the representation of knowledge is inaccurate, a [[knowledge component]]'s learning curve may have a huge jump in the middle or be quite jagged
