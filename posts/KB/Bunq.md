Q: How familiar are you with Python, SQL, AWS, and ETL processes?

I have a Masters in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. From my previous internship, experiences, personal and freelance projects, and research papers, I have a good amount of experience with AWS, SQL, and ETL processes.

At almost every internship, I helped build/used ETL pipelines that required SQL, AWS, or some other data storage, and I am comfortable with learning new processes that might be required for this position.

As for Python, it is my language of choice, and I am very familiar with it. I have experience working with creating data pipelines, data analysis, and AI/ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, NLTK, Hugging face, sklearn, etc. I have built several open-source packages in varying domains over the past couple of years and published many analytics and AI notebooks and articles as well.
