# Knowledge Component
```toc
```

- A knowledge component can be a principle, a concept, a rule, a procedure, a fact, an association or any other fragment of task-specific information.
- Despite the connotations of knowledge, a knowledge component can be incorrect, in that instructors would rather that students not apply this knowledge component while achieving a task.
