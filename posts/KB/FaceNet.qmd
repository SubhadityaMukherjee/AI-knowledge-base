# FaceNet
- [FaceNet: a Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
- mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity
- Optimize the [embedding](Embedding.qmd) itself
- FaceNet directly trains its output to be a compact 128-D [embedding](Embedding.qmd) using a [Triplet Loss](Triplet%20Loss.qmd) function
- Choosing which triplets to use turns out to be very important for achieving good performance
	- inspired by [curriculum learning](Curriculum%20Learning.qmd)
	- online negative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasing difficulty of triplets as the network trains
	- also explore hard-positive mining techniques which encourage spherical clusters for the embeddings of a single person
- squared [Lp Regularization](Lp%20Regularization.qmd) L2 distance, in the [embedding](Embedding.qmd) space directly correspond to face similarity: faces of the same person have small distances and faces of distinct people have large distances
- face verification simply involves thresholding the distance between the two embeddings; recognition becomes a [KNN](KNN) classification problem
- [Labeled Faces in the Wild](Labeled%20Faces%20in%20the%20Wild.qmd)
- [Zeiler Fergus](Zeiler%20Fergus.qmd)
- [Inception](Inception.qmd)
- [Harmonic Embedding](Harmonic%20Embedding)
