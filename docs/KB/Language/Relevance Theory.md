# Relevance Theory


- Relevance Theory is built on the assumption that attention and thought processes automatically turn toward information that seems relevant, capable of yielding cognitive effects
- As the Principle of Relevance states, communicated information comes with a guarantee of relevance.
- The higher the cognitive effect of the information, and/or the more economically it is communicated, the greater its relevance.
