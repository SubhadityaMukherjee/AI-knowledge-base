- **12:22** I spent a while thinking of my thesis and came up with a proper training workflow. I think?
- **01:58** Okay sent an email to the prof with the details. Honestly? Im kinda proud of myself. I actually planned something. Dahm xD
	- I just want to start ASAP because idk why. Im probably already way ahead of a lot of people just because I have a proper plan. Plus making a framework for the experiments will probably only take me a week or two. Maybe less if I sit and do it properly.
	- TF should I do for a whole year? Maybe I can do some more TA positions or freelance jobs. Dunno.
- Hmm. Ill work on the knowledge base again for a bit after a small break.
