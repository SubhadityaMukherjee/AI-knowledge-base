# Friction
- Friction scales linearly with the normal [force](Force.md).
- Friction is not affected by the area of contact between surfaces.
- Stationary objects have more friction than sliding objects.
- Sliding friction is not affected by sliding velocity.
- You can look up the magnitude of friction for each pair of materials
- [Static Friction](Static%20Friction.md)
- [Kinetic Friction](Kinetic%20Friction.md)
