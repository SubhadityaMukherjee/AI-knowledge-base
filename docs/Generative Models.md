# GAN
- [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- Learn a prob distribution directly from data generated by that distribution
- no need for any [[Markov Chain]] or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples
- [[Adversarial Learning]]
- ![[../assets/Pasted image 20220310210209.png]]
- Min Max game $$max_D min_G V(G,D)$$ where $$V(G,D) = \mathbb{E}_{p_{data}(x)}logD(x) + \mathbb{E}_{p_{data}(x)}log(1-D(x))$$
- G : [[Gradient Descent gradients]]
- D : [[Gradient Ascent]]
