# Leap Data Scientist

As I write this motivation letter, the temperatures in NL have hit yet another record for the hottest September ever. One of the biggest reasons for this is global warming, and fossil fuels are a massive component. Leap's mission to enable the shift to cleaner energy greatly resonates with me, so I am applying for this position as a Data Scientist. At the core of making the world a greener and healthier place is data that every company has collected for decades. Using that vast data pool to inform better decisions is quite challenging but equally rewarding.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI (such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, scikit-learn, and many others) and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. In my time at KPMG and Emirates NBD, I have worked on massive data analytics pipelines across every level, from data preprocessing to feature engineering to deploying analytics solutions. Python is my language of choice for analytics as well as Deep Learning and Machine learning and I am familiar with the common libraries in each of these domains.

In any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing solutions that have a positive impact, and this position will be the perfect next step for me. I will be able to contribute to any team I get to work with.

I hope you give me a chance to contribute to the efforts that we as a race must make for our future generations in the fight against climate change.
