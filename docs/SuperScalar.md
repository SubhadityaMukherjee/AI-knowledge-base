# SuperScalar
- A superscalar CPU architecture implements [[Instruction level programming]] inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate.
- A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle
- Simultaneously dispatches multiple instructions to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor.
