# Sampler
- Given : 
	- $P_{X}$ is a distribution on a measure space (E,B)
	- A seq of $X_{1}, X_{2}, …$ of random variables is a sampler if for all $A \in B$
	- $$P_{X}(A) = lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}1_{A}\circ X_{i}$$
	- $1_A$ is an indicator function for A
- $X_{1}, X_{2}, …$ need not have the same distribution or need to be independant
- Dream : All $X_{i}$ are uniformly distributed on [0,1]. (Impossible)
