## Game Based Learning
- gamified learning tasks
- improve engagement
- Learning progress
- Interactivity
	- Seductive details
		- interesting, but irrelevant
	- Should support a specific function
- Does it work?
	- Mixed
	- Studies use many game elements in a study - makes it hard to understand if any work
	- Not a lot of directed, guided
	- Makes it fun though
