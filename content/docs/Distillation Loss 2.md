# Distillation Loss
- $$\mathscr{l}(p, softmax(z))+T^{2}\mathscr{l}(softmax(\frac{r}{T}), softmax(\frac{z}{T}))$$
- Negative [Cross Entropy](Cross%20Entropy.md) + other
- p is the true [probability](Probability.md) [Distributions](Distributions)
- z,r are outputs of the student and teacher model
- T is the temperature to make [Softmax](Softmax.md) smoother
