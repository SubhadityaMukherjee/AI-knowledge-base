# Impulse
- An impulse is defined as a [force](Force.qmd) applied over a period of time. Applying a larger [force](Force.qmd) or longer lasting [force](Force.qmd) produces a larger impulse. A large impulse produces a large change in momentum.
- $$J = \Delta p $$
- $$F \Delta t = \Delta p$$
- $$F \Delta t = mv - mu$$
- $$F \Delta t = m \Delta v$$
- $$\Delta v = \frac{F}{m} \Delta t$$
- J is impulse in kg m/s
- F is [force](Force.qmd)
- p is momentum
- v,u is velocity
