# Law of Large Numbers
- If one carries out an infinite seq of independantly repeating same the same numerical mesurement and gets a sequence of measurement values $x_{1}, .. , x_{n}$ where $x_{i} \in \mathbb{R}$, then the mean value of the inital seq upto N will almost always converge to the same number $$\mu_{N} = \frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}$$ which is the EXPECTATION of X $$\mu_{N}=E[X]$$
