## Feature Augmentation
- Rather than conduct augmentation only in the input space, feature augmentation performs the transformation in a learned feature space 
- [DeVries and Taylor, 2017a] 
- when traversing along the manifold it is more likely to encounter realistic samples in feature space than compared to input space 
- manipulating the vector representation of data within a learned feature space are investigated
