# Attentions and Salience
- Learning is related to [Attention](Attention.md)
- We give more [Attention](Attention.md) to salient items
- Selective [Attention](Attention.md) leads to overshadowing
- Two cues presented together jointly predict outcomes
- salience (and then [Attention](Attention.md)) leads to one cue being strongly associated
- ther cue is only weakly associated (overshadowed)
- Overshadowing leads to blocking
- Blocking could model interference
- Children learn temporal adverbs like hier late (Dale and Fenson 1996)
- L2 learners go through phases where time is marked with adverbials alone (Bardovi-Harlig 1992; Meisel 1987)
- This seems to block acquisition of other cues
- temporal adverbs are highly salient (and easier) so they get stronger associations
- even though they co-occur with different [Verb](Verb.md) forms, these are hard to learn
