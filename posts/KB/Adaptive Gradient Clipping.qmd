# Adaptive [Gradient Clipping](Gradient Clipping.qmd)
- clips gradients to the ratio between weight gradient and weight value
- Clipping parameter is more robust than in traditional GC
- Swapping Batch Normalisation for AGC
    - faster training for equally sized models
    - Allows for even larger batch size training
