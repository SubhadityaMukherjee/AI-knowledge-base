- **11:32** Okay I have been here for an hour or so. I have been saving things to add to the KB from every course that has been given and is relevant. I found a script that would extract pdf highlights. (Already had one for the web). And now I wrote another to format it a little so it's easier.
	- I can now very easily just go through the merged pdfs, highlight what I need. And then find a way to add it to the database. Pretty neat.
	- Although now I should focus on important stuff
	- I also found a very nice seat here. I really like it.

- **11:37** that was fast and nice.
- Okay maybe till 12 I will do language modeling. Then will move on. This also has RNN's in it so that is definitely a bonus
- **11:54** Some more from the CSL stuff. then will move on to the code of RNNs and the lot

- **12:46** I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THE RNN, GRU AND LSTM DIAGRAMS. Stupid weird things. Its not even hard -.-. Good ol code saving my ass
