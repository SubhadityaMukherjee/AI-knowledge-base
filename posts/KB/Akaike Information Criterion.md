# Akaike Information Criterion
- Considers goodness-of-fit to the data and penalizes complexity of the model
- $$AIC=−2log⁡(L)+2q$$
- where:
- L: likelihood function for a particular model
- q: number of variables of this model
- If error terms $\epsilon$ follows [[Normal Distribution.md|Normal Distribution]] , expected value 0 + constant variance $$AIC = \frac{1}{\eta \sigma^{2}}(RSS + 2p \hat \sigma^2)$$
