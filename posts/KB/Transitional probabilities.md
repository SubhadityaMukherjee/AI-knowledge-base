# Transitional Probabilities
- $$\text{Prob of }Y|X = \frac{\text{freq of} XY}{\text{freq of }X}$$
- Longer listening times for non-words indicates recognition of words
- Transitional probabilities can be high within words, and low at word boundaries as in Aslin et al
- But then you can also manipulate the frequency at which each word occurs, and in doing so, also the frequency of the syllables
- Graf Estes et al
- Transition frequencies can be made high because two words occur very often next to each other
