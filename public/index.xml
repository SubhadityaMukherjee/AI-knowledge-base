    <description>Graph Neural Network model that takes the node embeddings X and the adjacency matrix A as inputs and passes them through a series of K layers. The node embeddings are updated at each layer to create intermediate “hidden” representations H_{k} before finally computing output embeddings H_{K} At the start of this network, each column of the input node embeddings X just contains information about the node itself.</description>
