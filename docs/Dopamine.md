# Dopamine
- Dopamine is chemically expressed as C2H11NO2.
- It is a neuro-chemical created in various parts of the brain and is critical for all kinds of brain functions including thinking, carrying, sleeping, mood, [[Attention|attention]], motivation, seeking and rewarding.
- The dopamine is responsible for the feeling of pleasure.
- When a person eats, drinks or performs a pleasurable action, dopamine is stimulated in his brain to repeat the action.
- Unexpected rewards increase the activity of dopamine neurons, acting as positive feedback signals for the brain regions associated with the preceding behavior.
- As learning takes place, the timing of activity will shift until it occurs upon the cue alone, with the expected reward having no additional effect.
	- And should the expected reward not be received, dopamine activity drops, sending a negative feedback signal to the relevant parts of the brain, weakening the positive association
