# GauGAN2
- named after post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin creates photorealistic images from simple elements a user can draw with simple graphic tools like a paintbrush or paint bucket.
- Artists can also combine sketches with a short text to design their own landscapes
- By analyzing different features of the work like brushstrokes and patterns, the AI technology does not need to examine paint, paper, or have access to the original work
- It can determine authenticity only through a digital photograph, without investigating the invisible layers of the work through traditional methods of authentication like microscopy, X-ray technology, or infrared reflectography.
