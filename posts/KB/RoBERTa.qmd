# RoBERTa
- [RoBERTa: a Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)
- evaluates a number of design decisions when pretraining BERT models
- They find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it.
- performance can be substantially improved by training the model longer, with bigger batches over more data; removing the next sentence prediction objective; training on longer sequences; and dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data
- [GLUE](GLUE.qmd)
- [RACE](RACE.qmd)
- [SQuAD](SQuAD.qmd)
- only the masked language model objective
