# Proto Distributions
- [Distributions](Distributions)
- Occur in [Bayesian](Bayesian.md)

## Continuous Spaces
- [Proto PDF](Proto%20PDF.md)
- $$p(x|\theta) = \frac{1}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}p_{0}(x| \theta)dx}p_{0}(x|\theta)$$
- $p_{0}$ gives the shape of the [PDF](PDF.md)
- $\frac{1}{\int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}p_{0}(x| \theta)dx}$ is a normalization so it integrates to 1

- Most of the time we dont know a distribution but only its proto distribution. This is actually enough sometimes
