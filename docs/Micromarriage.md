# Micromarriage
- [Micromarriages -- colah's blog](https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/)
- A micromarriage is a one in a million chance that an action will lead to you getting married, relative to your default policy.
- Note that some actions, such as dying, have a negative number of micromarriages associated with them.
- Most people do not include being coercively forced into a marriage when calculating micromarriages.
