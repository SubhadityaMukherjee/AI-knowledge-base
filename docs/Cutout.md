>   - Keep- Augment identifies the salient area in an image and assures the image generated by the augmenta- tion strategies, for example, [[Cutout]], [[RandAugment]] [14], [[CutMix]] [82] or [[AutoAugment]] [13], contains salient region in it.

>   - The algorithm tries to overcome drawbacks of [[Cutout]], [[Random Erasing]], and [[Hide and Seek]] that are prone to deleting important information entirely or leaving it untouched without making it harder for the algorithm to learn.

>   - matching closely with the [[Cutout]] and [[CutMix]] techniques

>   - [[Cutout]] and [[CutMix]] argues that hindering image regions enforces the classifier to learn from the partially visible objects and understand the overall structure
