- **11:17** Okay Im here at the library. Today I want to focus on finishing the CCN paper (there were only a few comments). After that the rest of the time I want to work on tomorrows workshop. I feel like itll be fine if i write it down
	- As a start, I want to continue some KB work that I started yesterday from this [blog](https://github.com/christianversloot/machine-learning-articles/blob/main/) . Its no longer a website for some reason, so Id rather get the materials. Some of the pages are genuinly awesome
- **11:18** [DALL-E](DALL-E)
- **11:21** There are some common transforms I keep having to make while copying from these blogs. Ill make a quick script to help me make them instantly
- **12:40** Forgot to mention, I re-added most of the [Optimizers](../Optimizers.md) and have been looking at comments in the paper
	- Its not too bad. I fixed some of the minor ones. Now working on the bigger ones. Ill probably be done in an hour or so.
	- Then maybe ill take a small break and come back to work on the workshop. Lets see how it goes.
	- I do feel kinda anxious rn.
