# Cogntition Hazard Rates

- {Proven wrong} : [[Cognitive fMTP]]
- Mathematical construct about probability
- Continuously tracking the odds the event appeads rn given it has not happened yet
- Idea : Use this "hazard rate" to decide when to prepare
- RT is proportional to hazard
- Optimally prepared if certain

## Distributions Used (PDF)
- Constant, exponential, flipped exponential
- Hazard rate is this pdf by 1-F
- $$h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}$$

## Hazard Rates
- How does that translate to RT?
- Proposed
	- $RT = c- h(t)$ : linear effect
	- $RT = c+ \frac{1}{h(t)}$ : inverse relation
- dashed : $\frac{1}{hazard}$

## Vs ACT-R
 - Prepare for ‘the right moment’  
	- ‘degree of preparation’ given by moment-to-moment hz  
- ‘the right moment’ is estimated based on time (pulses) and memory (DM)  
	- No ‘time’, no explicit memory?  
- If we are prepared→ benefit, else cost  
	- [[Scaled benefits]] (useful for assignment)
	- Does not specify why/how; i.e., what preparation is  
- No active process during the interval  
	- [[Active tracking]]
- Once we are prepared, it doesn’t ‘go away’  
	- A by-product of the Hazard rate
- No memory model  
	- Such mathematical models give no mechanism for how the pdf is stored in memory, retrieved, or used…

## Problems
- Does not explain preparation
- How do particpants ‘learn’ the distribution?
- Do participants truly track ‘conditional probabilities’ throughout the foreperiod

## Extending
- Does not store PDFs in memory, which sucks
	- Does not keep track of time as well
- Subjective hazard/ anticipation function
	- Temporal uncertainty
	- Blur the pdf such that later points are less certain using a [[Gaussian Filter]] that gets wider for later points in time
	- $$f'(t) = \frac{1}{\theta t \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\tau)e^{-\frac{(r-t)^{2}}{2 \theta^{2}t^{2}}}d \tau$$
	- Climb to 1 after a while
	- Hazard is more even though probs are equal in classical. This equates them and makes them less blurred out
