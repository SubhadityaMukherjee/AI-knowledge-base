# SpecAugment
- [SpecAugment: a Simple Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08779)
- simple data augmentation method for speech recognition
- applied directly to the feature inputs of a neural network
- warping the features, masking blocks of frequency channels, and masking blocks of time steps
- apply SpecAugment on Listen, Attend and Spell (LAS) networks for end-to-end speech recognition tasks
- [[LibriSpeech]]
- [[Swichboard]]
- end-to-end LAS networks by augmenting the training set using simple handcrafted policies
- converts ASR from an over-fitting to an under-fitting problem, and they are able to gain performance by using bigger networks and training longer
