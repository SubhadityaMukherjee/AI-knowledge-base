# Co Adaptation
- Computing the gradient is done with respect to the error, but also with respect to what all other units are doing (Srivastava et al., 2014). This means that certain neurons, through changes in their weights, may fix the mistakes of other neurons. These, Srivastava et al. (2014) argue, lead to complex co-adaptations that may not generalize to unseen data, resulting in overfitting.
