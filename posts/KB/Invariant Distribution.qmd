# Invariant Distribution
- If g is the [PDF](PDF.qmd). T(x|y) is the [PDF](PDF.qmd) of the transition kernel. Homogenous [Markov Chain](Markov%20Chain.qmd). Then g is [PDF](PDF.qmd) of an invariant distribution of T(x|y) if
- $$g(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{k}}T(x|y)g(y)dy$$
- Atleast one invariant distribution
- [Ergodic](Ergodic.qmd)
