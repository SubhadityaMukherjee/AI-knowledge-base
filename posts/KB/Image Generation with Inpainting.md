## Image Generation with Inpainting
- ![img_p15_1](img_p15_1.png) 
- Image inpainting is a task of predicting arbitrary missing regions based on the rest of an image 
- To correctly predict missing regions, networks are required to learn the common knowledge including the color and structure of the common objects 
- Only by knowing this knowledge, networks are able to infer missing regions based on the rest part of the image.
