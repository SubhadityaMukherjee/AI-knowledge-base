# Tree Cover Segmentation
- treecover segmentation [[PointNet++]]
	- Data collected from above
	- Normalization : height, xy
	- Rotation
	- Jiggling ??
	- Labeling
		- ![[assets/Pasted image 20220318094643.png|im]] Segmentation algorithm. Canopy hide model
		- Weighted loss + [[Focal Loss]]
## 2d Methods
- [[Watershed]] + [[Unet]]
