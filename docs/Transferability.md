# Transferability
```toc
```

- Explainability is also an advocate for transferability, since it may ease the task of elucidating the boundaries that might affect a model, allowing for a better understanding and implementation
- the mere understanding of the inner relations taking place within a model facilitates the ability of a user to reuse this knowledge in another problem
- cases in which the lack of a proper understanding of the model might drive the user toward incorrect assumptions and fatal consequences
