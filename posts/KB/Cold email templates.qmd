"_Hi Betsy,_

_My name is Alison Parker. I'm a freelance writer covering science and psychology. I've written for several publications, including **[X]**, **[Y]** and **[Z publications]**. I've been doing this work for about three years, and I'm really passionate about making people think critically about the world._

_My former boss, **[X boss' name]**, who you used to work with at **[X company]**, mentioned you when I told her I was looking for a full-time position. She said your magazine is hiring a senior science reporter. I was pleasantly surprised to hear your name, as I've been reading your work for years! I especially enjoyed the cover story you wrote for **[X name of publication]** in 2016 about the psychology of consumer spending._

_I submitted an application for the position online, but even if things don't work out, I'd be so grateful for a 30 minute call to learn about your experience and what advice you have for young professionals in this field. I'm free any time after 3 p.m. (ET) on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week._

_(P.S. I saw your call on Twitter for volunteers to help at the food drive at **[X location]** this weekend. I organized a few of these in college and would love to help out, so count me in!)_

_Thanks so much for your time,_  
_Alison"_
