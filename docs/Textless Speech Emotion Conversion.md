# Textless Speech Emotion Conversion
- [Textless Speech Emotion Conversion Using Discrete and Decomposed Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07402)
- Speech emotion conversion
- modifying the perceived emotion of a speech utterance while preserving the lexical content and speaker identity
- spoken language translation task
- decomposition of the speech signal into discrete learned representations, consisting of phonetic-content units, prosodic features, speaker, and emotion
- modify the speech content by translating the phonetic-content units to a target emotion, and then predict the prosodic features based on these units
- speech waveform is generated by feeding the predicted representations into a neural vocoder
- beyond spectral and parametric changes of the signal
- model non-verbal vocalizations, such as laughter insertion, yawning removal, etc
