- # Graph-based Visual Saliency
- TODO
- exploits channel-wise feature maps computed by linear filtering followed by a nonlinear transformation.
- To estimate saliency maps, the feature maps are transformed into activation maps and normalised by using the fully-connected directed graph of the feature maps.
