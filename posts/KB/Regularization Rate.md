# [Regularization](Regularization.md) Rate
- A scalar value, represented as lambda, specifying the relative importance of the [regularization](regularization.md) function.
- Raising the [regularization](regularization.md) rate reduces overfitting but may make the model less accurate.
- # re-ranking
- The final stage of a recommendation system, during which scored items may be re-graded according to some other (typically, non-ML) algorithm. Re-ranking evaluates the list of items generated by the scoring phase, taking actions such as
	- Eliminating items that the user has already purchased.
	- Boosting the score of fresher items.
