# Klue ML Engineer



- We are looking for Machine Learning Engineers to work with our team to deliver high quality products in the most efficient way.  
  
We build machine learning services and data pipelines to automatically extract insights about competitors from both public and internal data sources. Every day, our services process millions of data points, including news articles, press releases, webpage changes, Slack posts, emails, reviews, CRM opportunities, and user actions. We utilize a broad array of ML techniques, including classification, clustering, recommendation, summarization, prompt engineering, vector search, and retrieval augmented generation.  
  
ðŸ’¡Klue + You?  
  
Q: Klue who?  
  
A: Weâ€™re Klue and from a technical perspective, Klueâ€™s mission is to descale huge amounts of data to the human level, so people can process it and make use of it. Klue is that trusted intermediary, right now itâ€™s proven for sales enablement, but tomorrow itâ€™s all teams enablement.  
  
Q: What level of experience are we looking for?  
  
A: Right now, we are looking for experienced senior-level Machine Learning Engineers.  
  
Q: What are we working on?  
  
A: Services for collecting, processing and generating timely, relevant intel that is accurately linked to competitors, products, industries, and people. Our Machine Learning Engineers are primarily focused on the training, evaluation, and deployment of models to label, score, cluster, and generate insights.  
  
Q: What technologies do we use?  
  
A: Python, Transformers, Pytorch, Hugging Face, Spacy, Sklearn, Pinecone, Kubeflow, Vertex AI, BentoML, Aporia, JS, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, GCP, BigQuery, Docker/Kubernetes, Github, GPT.  
  
We believe in using whatever tools make sense to get the job done and support our game-changing innovation.  
  
Q: What skills do you bring?  
  

- You are an expert on the landscape of transformer models and are proficient with popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, or Scikit-Learn.
- You stay up to date on recent advances with LLMs and you demonstrate astute judgment in deciding whether to train a model with a custom architecture or leverage GPT.
- You ensure your experiments are reproducible, balancing swift discovery with scientific rigor.
- You are proficient in designing, implementing, and deploying RESTful APIs and you have experience with (non)relational and vector databases.
- You demonstrate good judgment when making architectural decisions and you understand how those decisions fit into the bigger picture  
      
      
    

Q: What about total compensation & benefits?  
  

- Benefits. We currently have a pension plan for our EU team
- Time off. Take what you need. We want the team to prioritize wellness and avoid burnout. We want to also give individuals autonomy to choose how and when they take vacation. We understand and respect that everyoneâ€™s needs for time off are different, just like our team
