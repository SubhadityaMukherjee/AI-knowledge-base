# MRI
- Studies brain anatomy
- 1 image
- 1mm
- 1) Put subject in big magnetic field (leave him there)  
- 2) Transmit radio waves into subject [about 3 ms]  
- 3) Turn off radio wave transmitter  
- 4) Receive radio waves re-transmitted by subject  
	- Manipulate re-transmission with magnetic fields during this readout interval [10-100 ms: MRI is not a snapshot]  
- 5) Store measured radio wave data vs. time  
	- Now go back to 2) to get some more data  
- Process raw data to reconstruct images  
- Allow subject to leave scanner
