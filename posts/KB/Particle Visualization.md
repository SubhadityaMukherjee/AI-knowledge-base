# Particle [Visualization](visualization.md)
- points with only a (3D) coordinate
- potentially enriched with attributes like radius, velocity, etc.
- scattered data [Data Structures](Data%20Structures.md)
- lack of topological information (neighborhood)
- typically many particles (e.g. atoms, galaxies)
- Atomistic [visualization](visualization.md)
- via glyphs (i.e. spheres)
- explicit (geometry) or implicit [Raycasting](Raycasting.md)
- Surface-based [visualization](visualization.md)
- extract surface geometry
- particles: point samples describing a surface (e.g. in fluids or molecules)
- Volume-based [visualization](visualization.md)
- particles: point samples of a volume
- [Raycasting](Raycasting.md) and hierarchical [Data Structures](Data%20Structures.md)
