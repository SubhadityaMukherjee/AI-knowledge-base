# Brain Cortex
- Also called Cerebral Cortex
- It has a folded appearance with hills and valleys
- The nerve cell bodies color the cortex grey-brown giving it its name – gray matter
- Beneath the cortex are long nerve fibers (axons) that connect [Brain_Areas](Brain_Areas.md) to each other — called white matter
