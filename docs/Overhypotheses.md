# Overhypotheses
- Parse [trees](Trees.md) for sentences,
- These can be explained related to grammar
- Grammars are structured according to general princples in Universal grammar
- Do children generalize learned object names as representing shape rather than other [features](Features.md)? Yes!
- [First order generalization](First%20order%20generalization.md)
- [Second order generalization](Second%20order%20generalization.md)
- Suggests that learning of overhypotheses can also be modeled with [Bayesian](Bayesian.md) learning
