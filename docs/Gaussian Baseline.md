# Gaussian Baseline
```toc
```

- One of the first propositions was to add Gaussian noise to the original image
- Gaussian baseline was introduced by Smilkov et al. @smilkovSmoothGradRemovingNoise2017
- used a Gaussian distribution centered on the current image with a variance σ\\sigmaσ.
- This variance is the only parameter when tuning the method
- This is in [[Smooth-Grad]]
