  <h1>Random Quotes</h1>
  This page displays 10 random Quotes from my personal repository of Quotes I have collected (and continue to collect) over the years. Sadly, most of them do not have any citations. I will eventually try to write a script that finds the authors of the same. 
  These have been collected from books, websites, movies and music and each of them has taught me something over the years. Here I am sharing them with you, dear visitor :)

<form action="/random_points" method="POST">
    <button type="submit">Show 10 Random Quotes</button>
  </form>

  <ul>
    {% for point in points %}
      <li>{{ point }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
