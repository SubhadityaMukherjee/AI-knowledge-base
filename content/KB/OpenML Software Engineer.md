# Software Engineer - Deep Learning Application

Hello Joaquin,  

My name is Subhaditya, it is nice to meet you :)

I recently graduated with a masters in AI from the RUG (Groningen), and am now looking for a job in the Netherlands. I remember seeing the OpenML Github repo a while back and thinking it would be really cool to work with AI researchers with a love for open source. But I had just started my masters then, and somehow did not end up reaching out. So when I found this position while looking through Academic Transfer, I absolutely had to apply. I have been working with software engineering and AI for a few years now and I am very aware of the need for accurate benchmarks and sharing models efficiently. With so many people suddenly giving in to the AI hype, crafting tools that cater to the real problems of researchers trying to build AI, something like OpenML, is even more relevant now. Given that, I would love to bring my experience to this position, while also hopefully learning a lot from your team there too.

Over the past few years, I have worked with many clients (both freelance/part-time and in internships) and helped them bring their AI and data projects to life. My experience includes working with large datasets, building ML/DL models and pipelines and also sharing my knowledge with my peers in technical and non technical fields. I am quite good at using PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras and have some experience with Flux.jl and Max as well. I am also familiar with the Hugging Face API / PyTorch lightning and the ONNX format. More than anything though, I am a programmer at heart. I have been an avid believer in open source ever since I started using linux almost seven years ago, and although I have a lot to learn, I do think that I am a good fit for this position. (Here is my Github - [http://github.com/subhadityamukherjee](http://github.com/subhadityamukherjee))

This letter is getting a little long, but I did want to add that I would love to contribute to OpenML and bring about positive changes in the AI community going forward. So many people with not much AI experience are starting to enter this field, and perhaps we could help make their experience a lot smoother, while also promoting more open source research. I have no means of knowing how experienced the other candidates are, but I do hope you give me a shot!

PS. I still have my Zoekjaar visa till September, so I can start ASAP as well.
