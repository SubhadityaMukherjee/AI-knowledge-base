# [Gravity](Gravity.md) Loading
- The [Force](Force.md) exerted downward, due to the weight of the robot arm and/or the load at the end of the arm. The [Force](Force.md) creates an error with respect to position accuracy of the end effector. A compensating [Force](Force.md) can be computed and applied bringing the arm back to the desired position.
