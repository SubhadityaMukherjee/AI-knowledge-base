## Magic3D
- text to 3D model
- While the Dreamfusion model achieves remarkable results, the method has two problems
- long processing time
- low-quality of the generated images
- these problems are addressed by Magic3D using a two-stage optimization framework
- Magic3D builds a low-resolution difusion prior and, then, it accelerates with a sparse 3D hash grid structure
- a textured 3D mesh model is furthered optimized with an ecient diferentiable render
- higher quality 3D shapes in both geometry and texture compared to DreamFusion
