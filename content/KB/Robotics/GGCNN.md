# GGCNN
- Learning an object agnostic function to grasp objects
- Grasping using uni-modal data (depth image).  
- Generate pixel-wise grasp configuration for the given input.  
- The [Gripper](Gripper.md) approaches the target object in top-down manner. Uses a shallow network, and an eye-in-hand camera configuration.
