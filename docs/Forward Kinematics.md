# Forward Kinematics
- Computational procedures which determine where the [[End-effector|end-effector]] of a robot is located in space. The procedures use mathematical algorithms along with joint sensors to determine its location.
- 1. For a robot with n joints, what is the endeffector pose (ξ ), given the joint angles (q)
    - ξ = κ(q) : q = {qi,i ∈ [1,…,n]},
