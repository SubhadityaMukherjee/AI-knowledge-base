# VattenFall Motivation Letter - Subhaditya


As I write this motivation letter, the temperatures in NL have hit yet another record for the hottest September ever. One of the biggest reasons for this is global warming, and fossil fuels are a massive component. VattenFall's mission to be fossil-free in one generation and help customers shift towards sustainable energy sources using data greatly resonates with me, so I am applying for this position as a Data Scientist. At the core of making the world a greener and healthier place is data that every company has collected for decades. Using that vast data pool to inform better decisions is quite challenging but equally rewarding.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics/BI and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. In my previous internship at KPMG, I built 10+ dashboards using PowerBI and Azure for a project with the Abu Dhabi government. I have made several analytics pipelines and machine learning implementations in other internships. I am familiar with Python and can build advanced AI pipelines for many tasks.

In any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing solutions that have a positive impact, and I can contribute quite a bit to any team I get the chance to work with. If there is anything I do not know, I am also ready to develop those skills quickly.

I hope you give me a chance to be a part of the generation that finally starts relying on greener energy sources for our own and future generations.
