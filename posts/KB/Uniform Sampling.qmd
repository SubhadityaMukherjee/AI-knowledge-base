# Uniform [Sampling](Sampling)
- Random [Sampler](Sampler.qmd)
- [Uniform Distribution](Uniform%20Distribution.qmd)
- If need to sample from another distribution with a [PDF](PDF.qmd) f(x). Can use a uniform [Sampler](Sampler.qmd) on the distribution [0,1] to indirectly sample from it
	- Coordinate transform
	- [CDF](CDF.qmd)
	- Get a [Sampler](Sampler.qmd) for by $$X_{i} = \varphi^{-1}\circ U_{i}$$
