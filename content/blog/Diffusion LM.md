# Diffusion LM
- [Diffusion-LM Improves Controllable Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14217)
- Controlling the behavior of language models (LMs) without re-training is a major open problem in natural language generation
- non-[[autoregressive]] language model based on continuous diffusions
- substantial departure from the current paradigm of discrete [[autoregressive]] generation
- iteratively denoises a sequence of Gaussian vectors into word vectors, yielding a sequence of intermediate latent variables
- continuous, hierarchical nature of these intermediate variables enables a simple gradient-based algorithm to perform complex, controllable generation tasks
- successful control of Diffusion-LM for six challenging fine-grained control tasks
