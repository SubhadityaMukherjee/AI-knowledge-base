# Corpus Dependence
- Misspellings
- Erroneous Punctuations and Spacing
- Difficult to write rules to govern the corpora from the Internet
- Diﬃcult to prescribe rules governing the use of a written language
- Punctuations mean – Suprasegmentals in Spoken Language but might not be the same for corpora
- Algorithms may expect corpora need to obey some rules
