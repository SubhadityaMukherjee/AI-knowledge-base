- **10:30**  Well I woke up around here. Suddenly got some ideas about coding and stuff
- **11:59** I finally understand how to use equinox. Im just looking at their codebase. It is actually.. not that hard? But to get to transformers, I need to build everything from scratch. To understand it. The only thing I need to understand apart from it is how to get the data loaded nicely. But I feel like it is within my reach now. Equinox really is nice. It is pretty normal and not bogged down by a million things. 
	- https://d2l.ai/ is one of the best resources I have found so far
	- Once these things are created, I think I will be in the position to actually explore research papers. But of course, it would take time to get there. I think it is definitely worth it though.
	- But now I will eat something and focus on getting CCN together. I barely have like 5 days to finish it. I need to go through some papers and figure out what I want with them. But it will be okay I think.
- **12:13**   Okay this is distracting as hell. I should really eat and work on CCN. Enough of this for now.
- **12:58** Well I finally got down. Time to start work.
- **12:59** CCN. Here we go
- Background - what do we know now about it. Theres a gap
	- Main aims - outline what we will do. Characterize everything. Compare things. More difficult and easier versions
		- a 
	- Methodology - Just logic. Link between questions and answers
		- a
	- Hypothesized results - where the field arries. What will it do?
		- a
	- Sell the work  
		- a
- **01:21** Papers and what they talk about
	- A RESEARCH ON SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION AND DOPAMINE DRIVEN FEEDBACK
		- [Gaming addiction](../Gaming%20addiction.md)
		- A nice blurb about [Dopamine](../Dopamine.md)
		- [fMRI](../fMRI.md) that shows that regions are activated that lead to production of dopamine
		- Somewhat of an addiction
		- Social media being an ass
	- **01:33**  Oh found this paper which talks about what I want. And another one they cited for a similar thing. I might be on to something here
	- **01:40** Internet addiction and functional brain networks: task-related fMRI study
		- This one. This one answers a lot of questions
		- Task related [fMRI](../fMRI.md)
		- looking at specific brain regions, and their BOLD response
		- [[Default mode network]] changes
		- Only males were looked at. Consider more people? Different walks of life?
		- Maybe in the short/longer term?
		- The kind of changes were only observed in terms of people who answered that they were addicted to the internet
		- Should I look at the more short term effects of it? Say math problems or something? Maybe something that requires a bit more thinking. 
		- How should I take the people? With a quick survery like these people? Choosing different samples?
			- Two groups. One with content similar to the task and another with ones that are different
			- People of say different ages, but having too much variation is only possible if there are enough samples of each age. So instead maybe only focus on the "addicted" label?
