- **08:05** Been a while. Just want to add some stuff to the DB. Some timepass tbh. Maybe for 30 35 mins
- **08:26** I guess it would be nice to upgrade my little website formatter script with the filenames as tags. :/ Idk whats up with me and making this database. I feel like its the most important thing ive done so far in this domain. Idek why. But what to do. its just something I have to do I guess.
	- Okay lets see if I can make this script better.
- **08:35** Yeah idk about that. It seems like all im doing is redifining what Obsidian does already. Maybe I should just let it do its thing and focus on simple formatting only
