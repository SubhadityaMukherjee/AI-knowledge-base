# AUC-Judd
- "location-based metric"
- The true positive rate (TPR) is calculated as the proportion of fixations falling into the thresholded saliency map
- The false positive rate (FPR) is calculated as the proportion of no-fixated pixels in the thresholded saliency map.
- After calculating TPR and FPR at each threshold, the area under the curve (AUC) is calculated for the curve of TPR against FPR.
