- MIT
- wisdom of the crowd to find resolutions for ethical dilemmas
- studying the perception of autonomous vehicles (AVs) which are controlled by AI and has the potential to harm pedestrians and/or passengers if they malfunction
- allows participants to judge various ethical dilemmas facing AVs which have malfunctioned, and select which outcomes they prefer.
- saving more lives
- protecting passengers
- upholding the law
- avoiding intervention
- gender preference
- species preference
- age
- social value preference.
- people generally prefer the AV to make sacrifices if more lives can be saved.
- self-reported preferences often do not align well with actual behaviours
