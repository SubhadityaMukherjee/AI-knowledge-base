# AdaIn
- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868v2)
- $$AdaIN(x,y) = \sigma(y) \big( \frac{x-\mu(x)}{\sigma (x)} \big)$$
- Adaptive [[Instance Normalization]]Â is a normalization method that aligns the mean and variance of the content [[Features]] with those of the style [[Features]].
- no learnable affine [[Features]]
- Adaptively computes affine params from style input
