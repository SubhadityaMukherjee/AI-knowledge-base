## Codex
- translates text to code
- general-purpose programming model, as it can be applied to basically any programming task
- Programming can be broken down into two parts: breaking a problem down into simpler problems and mapping those problems into existing code (libraries, APIs, or functions) that already exist
- The second part is the most time-barring part for programmers, and it is where Codex excels the most
- model is fine-tuned from GPT-3, which already contains strong natural language representations
