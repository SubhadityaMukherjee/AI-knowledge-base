- Dermatologists recognize melanomas by inspecting images in which they identify human-comprehensible visual features.
- investigate to what extent such features correspond to the saliency areas identified on CNNs trained for classification
- Saliency maps are images that indicate the pixels areas contributing to a certain classification decision. Saliency maps are normally encoded as greyscale images or converted to heatmaps for visual inspection.
- to what extent saliency maps can be used to identify visual features of skin lesions
