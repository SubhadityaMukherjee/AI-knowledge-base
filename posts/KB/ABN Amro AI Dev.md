# ABN AMRO Motivation Letter - Subhaditya


During COVID, it became increasingly clear how important it was to have stable financial systems. No matter your position in the financial sector, it is essential to consider the customers affected by the pipeline. That being the case, many systems can be created to improve the user experience. I have been using ABN AMRO as my bank of choice ever since I came to the Netherlands two years ago, and recently, I started noticing many AI features such as predicted recurring costs, automated filling in of details from ID cards during new user creation, etc. Given the active development of such features, I am interested in an AI development position at ABN AMRO.

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Masters in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. In the past, I interned at the AI divisions of Emirates NBD (one of the largest banks in the UAE) and KPMG (one of the big four consultancy firms) in similar teams with similar goals of developing disruptive AI solutions, and I quite enjoyed the work there. Working in a team that has a start-up vibe but also in the context of a much larger system is also something that I enjoy. As this position offers something similar, I can contribute to any team I get the chance to work with.

In any team, it is essential that each of the members can contribute something to the overall development of the projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I genuinely enjoy developing AI solutions that have some impact, and I hope to get to work with the amazing AI team at ABN AMRO and ship some useful solutions to the users (myself included).
