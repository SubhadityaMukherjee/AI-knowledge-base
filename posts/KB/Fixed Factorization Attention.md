# Fixed Factorization [Attention](Attention.md)
- [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509v1)
- Specific cells summarize previous locations and propagate to all future cells.
- Part of [Sparse Transformer](Sparse%20Transformer.md)
- Fixed [attention](Attention.md) pattern with c = 1 limits expressivity
- many representations in the network are only used for one block whereas a small number of locations are used by all blocks.
- Choosing $c \in [8, 16, 32](Strided%20Attention.md)
- when using multiple heads, having them attend to distinct subblocks of length $c$ within the block of size $l$ was preferable to having them attend to the same subblock
