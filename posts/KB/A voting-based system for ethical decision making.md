- Ritesh Noothigattu, Snehalkumar ‘Neil’ S. Gaikwad, Edmond Awad, Sohan Dsouza, Iyad Rahwan, Pradeep Ravikumar, and Ariel D. Procaccia
- voting-based system for autonomous entities to make collective ethical decisions leverages data collected from the [Moral Machine project](Moral%20Machine%20project.md.md)
- Self reported preference over different outcomes under diverse ethical dilemmas are used to learn models of preference for the human voters over different alternative outcomes.
- individual models are then summarized to form a model that approximates the collective preference of all voters
