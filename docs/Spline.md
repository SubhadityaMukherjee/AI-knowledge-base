- A smooth, continuous function used to approximate a set of functions that are uniquely defined on a set of sub-intervals. The approximating function and the set of functions being approximated intersect at a sufficient number of points to insure a high degree of accuracy in the approximation. The purpose for the smooth function is to allow a robot [[Manipulator|manipulator]] to complete a task without jerky motion.
