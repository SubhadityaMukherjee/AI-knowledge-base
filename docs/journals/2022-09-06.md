- **12:39** I wrote a blog post on another blog post by Chip Huyen <https://msubhaditya.medium.com/notes-machine-learning-system-design-aeba04190856>
- [[../Prediction assumption]]

![[../IID]]

![[../Smoothness]]

![[../Tractability]]

![[../Conditional Independence]]

- **01:02** I wanted to also start working on my thesis. Just atleast have a rough sketch of what I want to achieve with it so I can talk to my supervisor about it.
	- I also realized that I can keep producing blogs. Just write "comments" on what I read, and add my own take to it. But more importantly, I have to not post everything I write or paint in one go. Maybe I can post twice a week or something. Depending on how much work load I have and what I feel like then.
	- Not sure how much engagement it can even get but then I have no pressure to write but I can just explore and talk about what I am working on.
	- I was watching an interview of [Kenji Lopez Alt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm1u5ZkIxCk&t=435s) and he said something like, he makes content for himself. And there are people who end up finding it useful. But because he does what he finds interesting and can contribute to (ADHD life), he ends up not feeling the pressure. But just putting himself out there in his most authentic self. Another video by [Adam Duff](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamDuffArt) also was saying something like that. The highest performers, and the people who are really in any field doing their best, are there because they found out what they can do. Authentically. They are not doing it for anyone else. The best work.. was for themsleves.
	- That reminds me a lot of the Dao. Anyway. I should get back to doing something or planning out what to do.
- **01:23** Putting this here so I can find it later - [Trouble Shooting Neural Networks](http://josh-tobin.com/assets/pdf/troubleshooting-deep-neural-networks-01-19.pdf)
- **01:29** [[../Gradient Checkpointing]] also seems like a very very interesting thing. I should check it out at some point.
- **02:03** Okay I should really take a break and eat something. I collected some papers looking for my thesis too. Maybe Ill take some time and flesh it out properly in time.
- I did get quite some work done this morning.
	- Did my bills
	- Sent emails about the course I wanted to drop out from
	- Sent emails about my work permit
	- Wrote a pretty decent article
	- Read some articles about MLOps
	- Collected quite a few papers around my thesis
	- Planned out the assignment dates for this block
- **02:05** Maybe I will take a walk, eat something and then sit and work a little more. My head is starting to wear out for now though, so I might just go home instead. Lets see what I feel like doing.
