# Centrifugal [[Force.md|Force]]
- When a body rotates about an axis other than one at it's center of mass, it exerts an outward radial [[Force.md|force]] called centrifugal [[Force.md|force]] upon the axis, which restrains it from moving in a straight tangential line. To offset this [[Force.md|force]], the robot must exert an opposing torque at the joint of rotation.
