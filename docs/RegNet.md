# RegNet
- network design paradigm
- discover design principles that generalize across settings
- arrives at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks
- widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function
- outperforms [EfficientNet](EfficientNet.md)
