# Bruckhaus - 2024 - RAG Does Not Work for Enterprises

- @bruckhausRAGDoesNot2024

## Intro
- implementing RAG effectively in real-world, enterprise settings poses several challenges.
- The retriever needs to efficiently search through massive, constantly-updated knowledge bases to find the most relevant information for each query \[Karpukhin et al., 2020\]
- The generator needs to intelligently fuse the retrieved content with its own learned knowledge to produce coherent and accurate outputs \[Shao et al., 2023\]
- the RAG system needs to satisfy stringent requirements around data security, privacy, interpretability, and auditability \[Arrieta et al., 2020\].

## Enterprise Requirements for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- include built-in access controls, anonymization techniques, and auditing mechanisms.
- intelligently blending advanced semantic search techniques with hybrid query strategies, advanced RAG solutions retrieve the most relevant and reliable information to augment the generation process
- such solutions must provide clear explanations and attributions for its outputs, enabling enterprises to trust and act on the insights with confidence.
- flexible, API-driven architecture and pre-built connectors for popular enterprise systems.

## Survey of Current RAG Approaches and Their Limitations
- Lack of fine-grained control over retrieval and generation processes, which is crucial for ensuring accuracy, consistency, and regulatory compliance \[Martorana et al., 2022, Anderljung et al., 2023, Rahwan et al., 2023\].
- Limited scalability and performance when dealing with massive, heterogeneous enterprise knowledge bases \[Ahmad et al. 2019 , Nambiar et al., 2023\].
- Insufficient explainability and auditability of RAG outputs, which is essential for building trust and accountability in high-stakes enterprise use cases \[Eibich et al. 2024, Gao et al. 2024, Kamath & Liu 2021\].
- Challenges in integrating RAG capabilities into existing enterprise systems and workflows, which often have complex security, governance, and data management requirements.
