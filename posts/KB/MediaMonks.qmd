# Media Monks Cover Letter

As Rogier Bikker's article on your website says, AI is truly taking the world by storm, but perhaps infinite content generation is not the key to customer engagement. At the end of the pipeline, what matters is the humans who use and are affected by technology. There are so many terms that keep showing up every day - ML, Computer Vision, Mixed reality. To most people, they do not mean much, but they have such tremendous potential if used wisely and with an understanding of the technologies. My interest is to help customers bring their visions to reality while also guiding them towards using AI better. 

My expertise is a combination of data analytics and computer vision, and as of a month ago, I also have a Master in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Groningen. I am familiar with the tools required for basic and advanced AI and analytics from internships, research projects, papers, freelance work, and many personal projects. But aside from that, I am an artist (Instagram : www.instagram.com/aiexistentialart). That being the case, I am quite familiar with Photoshop, Blender, and some other design and illustration tools. I've played with VR, can cook up demos on an Arduino, and am familiar with the technology behind StableDiffusion, RunwayML, MidJourney etc. Although I am not yet familiar with ZBrush, I do use Nomad Sculpt, and can learn pretty much any technology given time and some mentorship.

As for talking about technical stuff in simpler terms, I have taught plenty of people about AI in workshops, webinars, and through many events. I write articles regularly and have been freelancing as a content creator for many years now.

I have always loved creating concepts, both in my art (as a concept artist) and in my AI work. While it is impossible to be familiar with all the tools, they all share a common thread. That being the case, I will be able to contribute to any team I get to work with. It is not every day you find a position that you enjoy and also think you can contribute something to, and I sincerely hope you give me a chance to be a Monk with you :)
