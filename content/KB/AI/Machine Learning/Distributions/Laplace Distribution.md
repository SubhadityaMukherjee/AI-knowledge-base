# Laplace Distribution

- PDF ![](Pasted%20image%2020240828105230.png)
- $$f(x\mid \mu ,b)={\frac {1}{2b}}\exp \left(-{\frac {|x-\mu |}{b}}\right)$$
- where $\mu$ is a location parameter, and $b>0$ which is sometimes referred to as the "diversity", is a scale param If μ=0 and b=1 the positive half-line is exactly an [Exponential Distribution](Exponential%20Distribution.md) scaled by 1/2
- Kinda like [Normal Distribution](Normal%20Distribution.md) but normal distribution is expressed in terms of the squared difference from the mean μ, the Laplace density is expressed in terms of the absolute difference from the mean
