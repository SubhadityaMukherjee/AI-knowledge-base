# 2 X 2 Study
- First factor has 2 levels (The vs each)
- Second factor has 2 levels (Distributive vs. Collective situations)
- We are trying to see how these fixed factors effect responses
- We control the fixed factors
- We carefully design them so we know what category an item presented to a participant belongs to
