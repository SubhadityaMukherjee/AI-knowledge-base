# RandAugment
- [[Augmentation]]
- [[Issues]]
	- separate search phase
	- unable to adjust the [[Regularization]] strength based on model or dataset size
	- training small models on small datasets and subsequently applied to train larger models
- simple parameterization for targeting [[Augmentation|augmentation]] to particular model and dataset sizes
- [[CIFAR]], [[COCO]], [[SVHN]], [[ImageNet]]
- interpretable hyperparameter
